       "[' The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the\\nson of Abraham.\\n\\n Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas\\nand his brethren;  And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and\\nPhares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;  And Aram begat Aminadab;\\nand Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;  And Salmon\\nbegat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat\\nJesse;  And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat\\nSolomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;  And Solomon begat\\nRoboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;  And Asa begat\\nJosaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;  And\\nOzias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;\\n And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon\\nbegat Josias;  And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about\\nthe time they were carried away to Babylon:  And after they were\\nbrought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat\\nZorobabel;  And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim;\\nand Eliakim begat Azor;  And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat\\nAchim; and Achim begat Eliud;  And Eliud begat Eleazar; and\\nEleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;  And Jacob begat\\nJoseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called\\nChrist.\\n\\n So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen\\ngenerations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are\\nfourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto\\nChrist are fourteen generations.\\n\\n Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his\\nmother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was\\nfound with child of the Holy Ghost.\\n\\n Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to\\nmake her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.\\n\\n But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the\\nLORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David,\\nfear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived\\nin her is of the Holy Ghost.\\n\\n And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name\\nJESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.\\n\\n Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was\\nspoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,  Behold, a virgin shall\\nbe with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his\\nname Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.\\n\\n Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord\\nhad bidden him, and took unto him his wife:  And knew her not till\\nshe had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.\\n\\n Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of\\nHerod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to\\nJerusalem,  Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for\\nwe have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.\\n\\n When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and\\nall Jerusalem with him.\\n\\n And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the\\npeople together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.\\n\\n And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is\\nwritten by the prophet,  And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda,\\nart not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall\\ncome a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.\\n\\n Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of\\nthem diligently what time the star appeared.\\n\\n And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently\\nfor the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again,\\nthat I may come and worship him also.\\n\\n When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star,\\nwhich they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood\\nover where the young child was.\\n\\n When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.\\n\\n And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child\\nwith Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they\\nhad opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and\\nfrankincense and myrrh.\\n\\n And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to\\nHerod, they departed into their own country another way.\\n\\n And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord\\nappeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young\\nchild and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I\\nbring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.\\n\\n When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night,\\nand departed into Egypt:  And was there until the death of Herod:\\nthat it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the\\nprophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.\\n\\n Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was\\nexceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were\\nin Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and\\nunder, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the\\nwise men.\\n\\n Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet,\\nsaying,  In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and\\nweeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and\\nwould not be comforted, because they are not.\\n\\n But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth\\nin a dream to Joseph in Egypt,  Saying, Arise, and take the young\\nchild and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are\\ndead which sought the young child’s life.\\n\\n And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came\\ninto the land of Israel.\\n\\n But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room\\nof his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding,\\nbeing warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of\\nGalilee:  And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it\\nmight be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be\\ncalled a Nazarene.\\n\\n In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness\\nof Judaea,  And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at\\nhand.\\n\\n For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying,\\nThe voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the\\nLord, make his paths straight.\\n\\n And the same John had his raiment of camel’s hair, and a leathern\\ngirdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.\\n\\n Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region\\nround about Jordan,  And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing\\ntheir sins.\\n\\n But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his\\nbaptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned\\nyou to flee from the wrath to come?   Bring forth therefore fruits\\nmeet for repentance:  And think not to say within yourselves, We\\nhave Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of\\nthese stones to raise up children unto Abraham.\\n\\n And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees:\\ntherefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down,\\nand cast into the fire.\\n\\n I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance. but he that\\ncometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to\\nbear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire: \\nWhose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and\\ngather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with\\nunquenchable fire.\\n\\n Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be\\nbaptized of him.\\n\\n But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee,\\nand comest thou to me?   And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer\\nit to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.\\nThen he suffered him.\\n\\n And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the\\nwater: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the\\nSpirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:  And\\nlo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am\\nwell pleased.\\n\\n Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be\\ntempted of the devil.\\n\\n And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was\\nafterward an hungred.\\n\\n And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of\\nGod, command that these stones be made bread.\\n\\n But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by\\nbread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of\\nGod.\\n\\n Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him\\non a pinnacle of the temple,  And saith unto him, If thou be the\\nSon of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his\\nangels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee\\nup, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.\\n\\n Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the\\nLord thy God.\\n\\n Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain,\\nand sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;\\n And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou\\nwilt fall down and worship me.\\n\\n Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is\\nwritten, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou\\nserve.\\n\\n Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and\\nministered unto him.\\n\\n Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he\\ndeparted into Galilee;  And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in\\nCapernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and\\nNephthalim:  That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias\\nthe prophet, saying,  The land of Zabulon, and the land of\\nNephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the\\nGentiles;  The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and\\nto them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung\\nup.\\n\\n From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the\\nkingdom of heaven is at hand.\\n\\n And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon\\ncalled Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for\\nthey were fishers.\\n\\n And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of\\nmen.\\n\\n And they straightway left their nets, and followed him.\\n\\n And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the\\nson of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their\\nfather, mending their nets; and he called them.\\n\\n And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed\\nhim.\\n\\n And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues,\\nand preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of\\nsickness and all manner of disease among the people.\\n\\n And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him\\nall sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and\\nthose which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick,\\nand those that had the palsy; and he healed them.\\n\\n And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee,\\nand from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from\\nbeyond Jordan.\\n\\n And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he\\nwas set, his disciples came unto him:  And he opened his mouth, and\\ntaught them, saying,  Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is\\nthe kingdom of heaven.\\n\\n Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.\\n\\n Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.\\n\\n Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness:\\nfor they shall be filled.\\n\\n Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.\\n\\n Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.\\n\\n Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children\\nof God.\\n\\n Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake:\\nfor theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\\n\\n Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and\\nshall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.\\n\\n Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in\\nheaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.\\n\\n Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his\\nsavour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for\\nnothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.\\n\\n Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill\\ncannot be hid.\\n\\n Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on\\na candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.\\n\\n Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good\\nworks, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\\n\\n Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I\\nam not come to destroy, but to fulfil.\\n\\n For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or\\none tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.\\n\\n Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments,\\nand shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of\\nheaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be\\ncalled great in the kingdom of heaven.\\n\\n For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed\\nthe righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case\\nenter into the kingdom of heaven.\\n\\n Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt\\nnot kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:\\n But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother\\nwithout a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever\\nshall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but\\nwhosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.\\n\\n Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there\\nrememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;  Leave there\\nthy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy\\nbrother, and then come and offer thy gift.\\n\\n Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way\\nwith him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge,\\nand the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into\\nprison.\\n\\n Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence,\\ntill thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.\\n\\n Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt\\nnot commit adultery:  But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh\\non a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already\\nin his heart.\\n\\n And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from\\nthee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should\\nperish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.\\n\\n And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from\\nthee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should\\nperish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.\\n\\n It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him\\ngive her a writing of divorcement:  But I say unto you, That\\nwhosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of\\nfornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry\\nher that is divorced committeth adultery.\\n\\n Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time,\\nThou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine\\noaths:  But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven;\\nfor it is God’s throne:  Nor by the earth; for it is his\\nfootstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.\\n\\n Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make\\none hair white or black.\\n\\n But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever\\nis more than these cometh of evil.\\n\\n Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a\\ntooth for a tooth:  But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil:\\nbut whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the\\nother also.\\n\\n And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat,\\nlet him have thy cloak also.\\n\\n And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.\\n\\n Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of\\nthee turn not thou away.\\n\\n Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy\\nneighbour, and hate thine enemy.\\n\\n But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you,\\ndo good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully\\nuse you, and persecute you;  That ye may be the children of your\\nFather which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil\\nand on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.\\n\\n For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not\\neven the publicans the same?   And if ye salute your brethren\\nonly, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?  \\nBe ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is\\nperfect.\\n\\n Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them:\\notherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.\\n\\n Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet\\nbefore thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the\\nstreets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They\\nhave their reward.\\n\\n But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy\\nright hand doeth:  That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father\\nwhich seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.\\n\\n And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are:\\nfor they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of\\nthe streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They\\nhave their reward.\\n\\n But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou\\nhast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy\\nFather which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.\\n\\n But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for\\nthey think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.\\n\\n Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what\\nthings ye have need of, before ye ask him.\\n\\n After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in\\nheaven, Hallowed be thy name.\\n\\n Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.\\n\\n Give us this day our daily bread.\\n\\n And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.\\n\\n And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For\\nthine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.\\n\\n For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will\\nalso forgive you:  But if ye forgive not men their trespasses,\\nneither will your Father forgive your trespasses.\\n\\n Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad\\ncountenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto\\nmen to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.\\n\\n But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy\\nface;  That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father\\nwhich is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall\\nreward thee openly.\\n\\n Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and\\nrust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:  But\\nlay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust\\ndoth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: \\nFor where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\\n\\n The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be\\nsingle, thy whole body shall be full of light.\\n\\n But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of\\ndarkness.\\n\\nIf therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that\\ndarkness!   No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate\\nthe one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and\\ndespise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\\n\\n Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye\\nshall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye\\nshall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than\\nraiment?   Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither\\ndo they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth\\nthem. Are ye not much better than they?   Which of you by taking\\nthought can add one cubit unto his stature?   And why take ye\\nthought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow;\\nthey toil not, neither do they spin:  And yet I say unto you, That\\neven Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.\\n\\n Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day\\nis, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe\\nyou, O ye of little faith?   Therefore take no thought, saying,\\nWhat shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we\\nbe clothed?   (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:)\\nfor your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these\\nthings.\\n\\n But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and\\nall these things shall be added unto you.\\n\\n Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall\\ntake thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the\\nevil thereof.\\n\\n Judge not, that ye be not judged.\\n\\n For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what\\nmeasure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.\\n\\n And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but\\nconsiderest not the beam that is in thine own eye?   Or how wilt\\nthou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye;\\nand, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?   Thou hypocrite, first\\ncast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see\\nclearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye.\\n\\n Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your\\npearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn\\nagain and rend you.\\n\\n Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock,\\nand it shall be opened unto you:  For every one that asketh\\nreceiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it\\nshall be opened.\\n\\n Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he\\ngive him a stone?   Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a\\nserpent?   If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts\\nunto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven\\ngive good things to them that ask him?   Therefore all things\\nwhatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them:\\nfor this is the law and the prophets.\\n\\n Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad\\nis the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in\\nthereat:  Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which\\nleadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.\\n\\n Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing,\\nbut inwardly they are ravening wolves.\\n\\n Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of\\nthorns, or figs of thistles?   Even so every good tree bringeth\\nforth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.\\n\\n A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt\\ntree bring forth good fruit.\\n\\n Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and\\ncast into the fire.\\n\\n Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.\\n\\n Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into\\nthe kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which\\nis in heaven.\\n\\n Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not\\nprophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in\\nthy name done many wonderful works?   And then will I profess unto\\nthem, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.\\n\\n Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth\\nthem, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a\\nrock:  And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds\\nblew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded\\nupon a rock.\\n\\n And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them\\nnot, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon\\nthe sand:  And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the\\nwinds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the\\nfall of it.\\n\\n And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the\\npeople were astonished at his doctrine:  For he taught them as one\\nhaving authority, and not as the scribes.\\n\\n When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed\\nhim.\\n\\n And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord,\\nif thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.\\n\\n And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be\\nthou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.\\n\\n And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way,\\nshew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded,\\nfor a testimony unto them.\\n\\n And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a\\ncenturion, beseeching him,  And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at\\nhome sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.\\n\\n And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.\\n\\n The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou\\nshouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant\\nshall be healed.\\n\\n For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I\\nsay to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he\\ncometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.\\n\\n When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that\\nfollowed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no,\\nnot in Israel.\\n\\n And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west,\\nand shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom\\nof heaven.\\n\\n But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer\\ndarkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\\n\\n And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast\\nbelieved, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the\\nselfsame hour.\\n\\n And when Jesus was come into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s\\nmother laid, and sick of a fever.\\n\\n And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose,\\nand ministered unto them.\\n\\n When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were\\npossessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and\\nhealed all that were sick:  That it might be fulfilled which was\\nspoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities,\\nand bare our sicknesses.\\n\\n Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave\\ncommandment to depart unto the other side.\\n\\n And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will\\nfollow thee whithersoever thou goest.\\n\\n And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of\\nthe air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.\\n\\n And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first\\nto go and bury my father.\\n\\n But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their\\ndead.\\n\\n And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.\\n\\n And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch\\nthat the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.\\n\\n And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save\\nus: we perish.\\n\\n And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?\\nThen he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a\\ngreat calm.\\n\\n But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that\\neven the winds and the sea obey him!   And when he was come to the\\nother side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two\\npossessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so\\nthat no man might pass by that way.\\n\\n And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with\\nthee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us\\nbefore the time?   And there was a good way off from them an herd\\nof many swine feeding.\\n\\n So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer\\nus to go away into the herd of swine.\\n\\n And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went\\ninto the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran\\nviolently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters.\\n\\n And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city,\\nand told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the\\ndevils.\\n\\n And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they\\nsaw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts.\\n\\n And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own\\ncity.\\n\\n And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on\\na bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy;\\nSon, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.\\n\\n And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This\\nman blasphemeth.\\n\\n And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in\\nyour hearts?   For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven\\nthee; or to say, Arise, and walk?   But that ye may know that the\\nSon of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the\\nsick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.\\n\\n And he arose, and departed to his house.\\n\\n But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God,\\nwhich had given such power unto men.\\n\\n And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named\\nMatthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him,\\nFollow me. And he arose, and followed him.\\n\\n And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold,\\nmany publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his\\ndisciples.\\n\\n And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why\\neateth your Master with publicans and sinners?   But when Jesus\\nheard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a\\nphysician, but they that are sick.\\n\\n But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not\\nsacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to\\nrepentance.\\n\\n Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the\\nPharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?   And Jesus said\\nunto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the\\nbridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom\\nshall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.\\n\\n No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that\\nwhich is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is\\nmade worse.\\n\\n Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles\\nbreak, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put\\nnew wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.\\n\\n While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a\\ncertain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now\\ndead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.\\n\\n And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.\\n\\n And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood\\ntwelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:\\n For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I\\nshall be whole.\\n\\n But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said,\\nDaughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the\\nwoman was made whole from that hour.\\n\\n And when Jesus came into the ruler’s house, and saw the minstrels\\nand the people making a noise,  He said unto them, Give place: for\\nthe maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.\\n\\n But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by\\nthe hand, and the maid arose.\\n\\n And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.\\n\\n And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him,\\ncrying, and saying, Thou son of David, have mercy on us.\\n\\n And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him:\\nand Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They\\nsaid unto him, Yea, Lord.\\n\\n Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it\\nunto you.\\n\\n And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them,\\nsaying, See that no man know it.\\n\\n But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all\\nthat country.\\n\\n As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man\\npossessed with a devil.\\n\\n And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the\\nmultitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.\\n\\n But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince\\nof the devils.\\n\\n And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in\\ntheir synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing\\nevery sickness and every disease among the people.\\n\\n But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on\\nthem, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having\\nno shepherd.\\n\\n Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous,\\nbut the labourers are few;  Pray ye therefore the Lord of the\\nharvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.\\n\\n And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave\\nthem power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all\\nmanner of sickness and all manner of disease.\\n\\n Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon,\\nwho is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee,\\nand John his brother;  Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and\\nMatthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose\\nsurname was Thaddaeus;  Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot,\\nwho also betrayed him.\\n\\n These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not\\ninto the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans\\nenter ye not:  But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of\\nIsrael.\\n\\n And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.\\n\\n Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out\\ndevils: freely ye have received, freely give.\\n\\n Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses, \\nNor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet\\nstaves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.\\n\\n And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in\\nit is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.\\n\\n And when ye come into an house, salute it.\\n\\n And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if\\nit be not worthy, let your peace return to you.\\n\\n And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when\\nye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.\\n\\n Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land\\nof Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.\\n\\n Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye\\ntherefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.\\n\\n But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils,\\nand they will scourge you in their synagogues;  And ye shall be\\nbrought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony\\nagainst them and the Gentiles.\\n\\n But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye\\nshall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall\\nspeak.\\n\\n For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which\\nspeaketh in you.\\n\\n And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the\\nfather the child: and the children shall rise up against their\\nparents, and cause them to be put to death.\\n\\n And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that\\nendureth to the end shall be saved.\\n\\n But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another:\\nfor verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of\\nIsrael, till the Son of man be come.\\n\\n The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his\\nlord.\\n\\n It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the\\nservant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house\\nBeelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?  \\nFear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not\\nbe revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.\\n\\n What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye\\nhear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.\\n\\n And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill\\nthe soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and\\nbody in hell.\\n\\n Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall\\nnot fall on the ground without your Father.\\n\\n But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.\\n\\n Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.\\n\\n Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I\\nconfess also before my Father which is in heaven.\\n\\n But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny\\nbefore my Father which is in heaven.\\n\\n Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to\\nsend peace, but a sword.\\n\\n For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and\\nthe daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her\\nmother in law.\\n\\n And a man’s foes shall be they of his own household.\\n\\n He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of\\nme: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of\\nme.\\n\\n And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not\\nworthy of me.\\n\\n He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his\\nlife for my sake shall find it.\\n\\n He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me\\nreceiveth him that sent me.\\n\\n He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall\\nreceive a prophet’s reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in\\nthe name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward.\\n\\n And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones\\na cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto\\nyou, he shall in no wise lose his reward.\\n\\n And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his\\ntwelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their\\ncities.\\n\\n Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he\\nsent two of his disciples,  And said unto him, Art thou he that\\nshould come, or do we look for another?   Jesus answered and said\\nunto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and\\nsee:  The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers\\nare cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor\\nhave the gospel preached to them.\\n\\n And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.\\n\\n And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes\\nconcerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed\\nshaken with the wind?   But what went ye out for to see? A man\\nclothed in soft raiment?  behold, they that wear soft clothing are in\\nkings’ houses.\\n\\n But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you,\\nand more than a prophet.\\n\\n For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my\\nmessenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.\\n\\n Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there\\nhath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he\\nthat is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.\\n\\n And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of\\nheaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.\\n\\n For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.\\n\\n And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.\\n\\n He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.\\n\\n But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto\\nchildren sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows, \\nAnd saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have\\nmourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.\\n\\n For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath\\na devil.\\n\\n The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a\\nman gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners.\\nBut wisdom is justified of her children.\\n\\n Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty\\nworks were done, because they repented not:  Woe unto thee,\\nChorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which\\nwere done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have\\nrepented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.\\n\\n But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and\\nSidon at the day of judgment, than for you.\\n\\n And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be\\nbrought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in\\nthee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.\\n\\n But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land\\nof Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.\\n\\n At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father,\\nLord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the\\nwise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.\\n\\n Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.\\n\\n All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man\\nknoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father,\\nsave the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.\\n\\n Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will\\ngive you rest.\\n\\n Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly\\nin heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\\n\\n For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\\n\\n At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and\\nhis disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn and\\nto eat.\\n\\n But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy\\ndisciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day.\\n\\n But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he\\nwas an hungred, and they that were with him;  How he entered into\\nthe house of God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for\\nhim to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the\\npriests?   Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath\\ndays the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?\\n But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the\\ntemple.\\n\\n But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not\\nsacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.\\n\\n For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.\\n\\n And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:\\n And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And\\nthey asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that\\nthey might accuse him.\\n\\n And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that\\nshall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day,\\nwill he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?   How much then is a\\nman better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the\\nsabbath days.\\n\\n Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he\\nstretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.\\n\\n Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how\\nthey might destroy him.\\n\\n But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and\\ngreat multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;  And\\ncharged them that they should not make him known:  That it might\\nbe fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, \\nBehold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is\\nwell pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew\\njudgment to the Gentiles.\\n\\n He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his\\nvoice in the streets.\\n\\n A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not\\nquench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.\\n\\n And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.\\n\\n Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and\\ndumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake\\nand saw.\\n\\n And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of\\nDavid?   But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow\\ndoth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.\\n\\n And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom\\ndivided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or\\nhouse divided against itself shall not stand:  And if Satan cast\\nout Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom\\nstand?   And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your\\nchildren cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.\\n\\n But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom\\nof God is come unto you.\\n\\n Or else how can one enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil\\nhis goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil\\nhis house.\\n\\n He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not\\nwith me scattereth abroad.\\n\\n Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall\\nbe forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall\\nnot be forgiven unto men.\\n\\n And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall\\nbe forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it\\nshall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world\\nto come.\\n\\n Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the\\ntree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his\\nfruit.\\n\\n O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good\\nthings?  for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.\\n\\n A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth\\ngood things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth\\nevil things.\\n\\n But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,\\nthey shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.\\n\\n For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou\\nshalt be condemned.\\n\\n Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered,\\nsaying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.\\n\\n But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous\\ngeneration seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to\\nit, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:  For as Jonas was three\\ndays and three nights in the whale’s belly; so shall the Son of man be\\nthree days and three nights in the heart of the earth.\\n\\n The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation,\\nand shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas;\\nand, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.\\n\\n The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this\\ngeneration, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost\\nparts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a\\ngreater than Solomon is here.\\n\\n When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through\\ndry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.\\n\\n Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came\\nout; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.\\n\\n Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more\\nwicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last\\nstate of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also\\nunto this wicked generation.\\n\\n While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his\\nbrethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.\\n\\n Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren\\nstand without, desiring to speak with thee.\\n\\n But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my\\nmother?  and who are my brethren?   And he stretched forth his\\nhand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!\\n For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven,\\nthe same is my brother, and sister, and mother.\\n\\n The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea\\nside.\\n\\n And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he\\nwent into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.\\n\\n And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a\\nsower went forth to sow;  And when he sowed, some seeds fell by\\nthe way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:  Some fell\\nupon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they\\nsprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:  And when the\\nsun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they\\nwithered away.\\n\\n And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked\\nthem:  But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit,\\nsome an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.\\n\\n Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.\\n\\n And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou\\nunto them in parables?   He answered and said unto them, Because\\nit is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven,\\nbut to them it is not given.\\n\\n For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have\\nmore abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away\\neven that he hath.\\n\\n Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see\\nnot; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.\\n\\n And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By\\nhearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall\\nsee, and shall not perceive:  For this people’s heart is waxed\\ngross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have\\nclosed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with\\ntheir ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be\\nconverted, and I should heal them.\\n\\n But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they\\nhear.\\n\\n For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men\\nhave desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them;\\nand to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.\\n\\n Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.\\n\\n When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth\\nit not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was\\nsown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.\\n\\n But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he\\nthat heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;  Yet hath\\nhe not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation\\nor persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.\\n\\n He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth\\nthe word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches,\\nchoke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.\\n\\n But he that received seed into the good ground is he that\\nheareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and\\nbringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.\\n\\n Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of\\nheaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: \\nBut while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat,\\nand went his way.\\n\\n But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then\\nappeared the tares also.\\n\\n So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir,\\ndidst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it\\ntares?   He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants\\nsaid unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?  \\nBut he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also\\nthe wheat with them.\\n\\n Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of\\nharvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares,\\nand bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my\\nbarn.\\n\\n Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of\\nheaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed\\nin his field:  Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when\\nit is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so\\nthat the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.\\n\\n Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is\\nlike unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of\\nmeal, till the whole was leavened.\\n\\n All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and\\nwithout a parable spake he not unto them:  That it might be\\nfulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my\\nmouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret\\nfrom the foundation of the world.\\n\\n Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and\\nhis disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of\\nthe tares of the field.\\n\\n He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is\\nthe Son of man;  The field is the world; the good seed are the\\nchildren of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked\\none;  The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the\\nend of the world; and the reapers are the angels.\\n\\n As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so\\nshall it be in the end of this world.\\n\\n The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall\\ngather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do\\niniquity;  And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there\\nshall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.\\n\\n Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom\\nof their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.\\n\\n Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a\\nfield; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof\\ngoeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.\\n\\n Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man,\\nseeking goodly pearls:  Who, when he had found one pearl of great\\nprice, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.\\n\\n Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast\\ninto the sea, and gathered of every kind:  Which, when it was\\nfull, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into\\nvessels, but cast the bad away.\\n\\n So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come\\nforth, and sever the wicked from among the just,  And shall cast\\nthem into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of\\nteeth.\\n\\n Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They\\nsay unto him, Yea, Lord.\\n\\n Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is\\ninstructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an\\nhouseholder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and\\nold.\\n\\n And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these\\nparables, he departed thence.\\n\\n And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in\\ntheir synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence\\nhath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?   Is not this\\nthe carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren,\\nJames, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?   And his sisters, are\\nthey not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?\\n And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A\\nprophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own\\nhouse.\\n\\n And he did not many mighty works there because of their\\nunbelief.\\n\\n At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus, \\nAnd said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from\\nthe dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.\\n\\n For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in\\nprison for Herodias’ sake, his brother Philip’s wife.\\n\\n For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.\\n\\n And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude,\\nbecause they counted him as a prophet.\\n\\n But when Herod’s birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias\\ndanced before them, and pleased Herod.\\n\\n Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she\\nwould ask.\\n\\n And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me\\nhere John Baptist’s head in a charger.\\n\\n And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath’s sake, and\\nthem which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her.\\n\\n And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.\\n\\n And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel:\\nand she brought it to her mother.\\n\\n And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and\\nwent and told Jesus.\\n\\n When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert\\nplace apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him\\non foot out of the cities.\\n\\n And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved\\nwith compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.\\n\\n And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This\\nis a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away,\\nthat they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.\\n\\n But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to\\neat.\\n\\n And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two\\nfishes.\\n\\n He said, Bring them hither to me.\\n\\n And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and\\ntook the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he\\nblessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the\\ndisciples to the multitude.\\n\\n And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the\\nfragments that remained twelve baskets full.\\n\\n And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside\\nwomen and children.\\n\\n And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a\\nship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the\\nmultitudes away.\\n\\n And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a\\nmountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there\\nalone.\\n\\n But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves:\\nfor the wind was contrary.\\n\\n And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them,\\nwalking on the sea.\\n\\n And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were\\ntroubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.\\n\\n But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer;\\nit is I; be not afraid.\\n\\n And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me\\ncome unto thee on the water.\\n\\n And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship,\\nhe walked on the water, to go to Jesus.\\n\\n But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and\\nbeginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.\\n\\n And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him,\\nand said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?\\n And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.\\n\\n Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying,\\nOf a truth thou art the Son of God.\\n\\n And when they were gone over, they came into the land of\\nGennesaret.\\n\\n And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent\\nout into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that\\nwere diseased;  And besought him that they might only touch the\\nhem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.\\n\\n Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of\\nJerusalem, saying,  Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition\\nof the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.\\n\\n But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the\\ncommandment of God by your tradition?   For God commanded, saying,\\nHonour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother,\\nlet him die the death.\\n\\n But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It\\nis a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;  And\\nhonour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye\\nmade the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.\\n\\n Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,  This\\npeople draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with\\ntheir lips; but their heart is far from me.\\n\\n But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the\\ncommandments of men.\\n\\n And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and\\nunderstand:  Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man;\\nbut that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.\\n\\n Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that\\nthe Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?   But\\nhe answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not\\nplanted, shall be rooted up.\\n\\n Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the\\nblind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.\\n\\n Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this\\nparable.\\n\\n And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?   Do\\nnot ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth\\ninto the belly, and is cast out into the draught?   But those\\nthings which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and\\nthey defile the man.\\n\\n For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,\\nfornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:  These are the\\nthings which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not\\na man.\\n\\n Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and\\nSidon.\\n\\n And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and\\ncried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David;\\nmy daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.\\n\\n But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and\\nbesought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.\\n\\n But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep\\nof the house of Israel.\\n\\n Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.\\n\\n But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children’s\\nbread, and to cast it to dogs.\\n\\n And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which\\nfall from their masters’ table.\\n\\n Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy\\nfaith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made\\nwhole from that very hour.\\n\\n And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of\\nGalilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.\\n\\n And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that\\nwere lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at\\nJesus’ feet; and he healed them:  Insomuch that the multitude\\nwondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the\\nlame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of\\nIsrael.\\n\\n Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have\\ncompassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three\\ndays, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting,\\nlest they faint in the way.\\n\\n And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much\\nbread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?   And\\nJesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven,\\nand a few little fishes.\\n\\n And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.\\n\\n And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks,\\nand brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the\\nmultitude.\\n\\n And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the\\nbroken meat that was left seven baskets full.\\n\\n And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and\\nchildren.\\n\\n And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the\\ncoasts of Magdala.\\n\\n The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired\\nhim that he would shew them a sign from heaven.\\n\\n He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It\\nwill be fair weather: for the sky is red.\\n\\n And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky\\nis red and lowering. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the\\nsky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?   A wicked and\\nadulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be\\ngiven unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them,\\nand departed.\\n\\n And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had\\nforgotten to take bread.\\n\\n Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of\\nthe Pharisees and of the Sadducees.\\n\\n And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have\\ntaken no bread.\\n\\n Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little\\nfaith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no\\nbread?   Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five\\nloaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?  \\nNeither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye\\ntook up?   How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it\\nnot to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of\\nthe Pharisees and of the Sadducees?   Then understood they how\\nthat he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the\\ndoctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.\\n\\n When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked\\nhis disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?\\n And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some,\\nElias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.\\n\\n He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?   And Simon\\nPeter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living\\nGod.\\n\\n And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon\\nBarjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my\\nFather which is in heaven.\\n\\n And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this\\nrock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail\\nagainst it.\\n\\n And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and\\nwhatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and\\nwhatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\\n\\n Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that\\nhe was Jesus the Christ.\\n\\n From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how\\nthat he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders\\nand chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the\\nthird day.\\n\\n Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far\\nfrom thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.\\n\\n But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan:\\nthou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be\\nof God, but those that be of men.\\n\\n Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after\\nme, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.\\n\\n For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever\\nwill lose his life for my sake shall find it.\\n\\n For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world,\\nand lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his\\nsoul?   For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father\\nwith his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his\\nworks.\\n\\n Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall\\nnot taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his\\nkingdom.\\n\\n And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his\\nbrother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,  And\\nwas transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and\\nhis raiment was white as the light.\\n\\n And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking\\nwith him.\\n\\n Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us\\nto be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for\\nthee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.\\n\\n While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and\\nbehold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son,\\nin whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.\\n\\n And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and\\nwere sore afraid.\\n\\n And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not\\nafraid.\\n\\n And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save\\nJesus only.\\n\\n And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them,\\nsaying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again\\nfrom the dead.\\n\\n And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes\\nthat Elias must first come?   And Jesus answered and said unto\\nthem, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.\\n\\n But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew\\nhim not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall\\nalso the Son of man suffer of them.\\n\\n Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John\\nthe Baptist.\\n\\n And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a\\ncertain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,  Lord, have mercy\\non my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth\\ninto the fire, and oft into the water.\\n\\n And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.\\n\\n Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse\\ngeneration, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you?\\nbring him hither to me.\\n\\n And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the\\nchild was cured from that very hour.\\n\\n Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not\\nwe cast him out?   And Jesus said unto them, Because of your\\nunbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of\\nmustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder\\nplace; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.\\n\\n Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.\\n\\n And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son\\nof man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:  And they shall\\nkill him, and the third day he shall be raised again.\\n\\nAnd they were exceeding sorry.\\n\\n And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute\\nmoney came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?\\n He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus\\nprevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings\\nof the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of\\nstrangers?   Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto\\nhim, Then are the children free.\\n\\n Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea,\\nand cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when\\nthou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that\\ntake, and give unto them for me and thee.\\n\\n At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is\\nthe greatest in the kingdom of heaven?   And Jesus called a little\\nchild unto him, and set him in the midst of them,  And said,\\nVerily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little\\nchildren, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.\\n\\n Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child,\\nthe same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.\\n\\n And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name\\nreceiveth me.\\n\\n But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in\\nme, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his\\nneck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.\\n\\n Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that\\noffences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!  \\nWherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast\\nthem from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or\\nmaimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into\\neverlasting fire.\\n\\n And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from\\nthee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather\\nthan having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.\\n\\n Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I\\nsay unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of\\nmy Father which is in heaven.\\n\\n For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.\\n\\n How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be\\ngone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the\\nmountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?   And if so be\\nthat he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that\\nsheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.\\n\\n Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven,\\nthat one of these little ones should perish.\\n\\n Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell\\nhim his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou\\nhast gained thy brother.\\n\\n But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two\\nmore, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be\\nestablished.\\n\\n And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church:\\nbut if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an\\nheathen man and a publican.\\n\\n Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall\\nbe bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be\\nloosed in heaven.\\n\\n Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as\\ntouching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of\\nmy Father which is in heaven.\\n\\n For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there\\nam I in the midst of them.\\n\\n Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother\\nsin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?   Jesus\\nsaith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until\\nseventy times seven.\\n\\n Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king,\\nwhich would take account of his servants.\\n\\n And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which\\nowed him ten thousand talents.\\n\\n But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be\\nsold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to\\nbe made.\\n\\n The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying,\\nLord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.\\n\\n Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and\\nloosed him, and forgave him the debt.\\n\\n But the same servant went out, and found one of his\\nfellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on\\nhim, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.\\n\\n And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him,\\nsaying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.\\n\\n And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he\\nshould pay the debt.\\n\\n So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very\\nsorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.\\n\\n Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O\\nthou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou\\ndesiredst me:  Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy\\nfellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?   And his lord was\\nwroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all\\nthat was due unto him.\\n\\n So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye\\nfrom your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.\\n\\n And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings,\\nhe departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond\\nJordan;  And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them\\nthere.\\n\\n The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto\\nhim, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?\\n And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he\\nwhich made them at the beginning made them male and female,  And\\nsaid, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall\\ncleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?   Wherefore\\nthey are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined\\ntogether, let not man put asunder.\\n\\n They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing\\nof divorcement, and to put her away?   He saith unto them, Moses\\nbecause of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your\\nwives: but from the beginning it was not so.\\n\\n And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it\\nbe for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and\\nwhoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.\\n\\n His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with\\nhis wife, it is not good to marry.\\n\\n But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save\\nthey to whom it is given.\\n\\n For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their\\nmother’s womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of\\nmen: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the\\nkingdom of heaven’s sake. He that is able to receive it, let him\\nreceive it.\\n\\n Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should\\nput his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.\\n\\n But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to\\ncome unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.\\n\\n And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.\\n\\n And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good\\nthing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?   And he said\\nunto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that\\nis, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.\\n\\n He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder,\\nThou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not\\nbear false witness,  Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou\\nshalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\\n\\n The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from\\nmy youth up: what lack I yet?   Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt\\nbe perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou\\nshalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.\\n\\n But when the young man heard that saying, he went away\\nsorrowful: for he had great possessions.\\n\\n Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That\\na rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.\\n\\n And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through\\nthe eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of\\nGod.\\n\\n When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed,\\nsaying, Who then can be saved?   But Jesus beheld them, and said\\nunto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are\\npossible.\\n\\n Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken\\nall, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?   And Jesus\\nsaid unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me,\\nin the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his\\nglory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve\\ntribes of Israel.\\n\\n And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or\\nsisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my\\nname’s sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit\\neverlasting life.\\n\\n But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be\\nfirst.\\n\\n For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an\\nhouseholder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers\\ninto his vineyard.\\n\\n And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he\\nsent them into his vineyard.\\n\\n And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing\\nidle in the marketplace,  And said unto them; Go ye also into the\\nvineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their\\nway.\\n\\n Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did\\nlikewise.\\n\\n And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others\\nstanding idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day\\nidle?   They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith\\nunto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that\\nshall ye receive.\\n\\n So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his\\nsteward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from\\nthe last unto the first.\\n\\n And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they\\nreceived every man a penny.\\n\\n But when the first came, they supposed that they should have\\nreceived more; and they likewise received every man a penny.\\n\\n And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman\\nof the house,  Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and\\nthou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and\\nheat of the day.\\n\\n But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no\\nwrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?   Take that\\nthine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto\\nthee.\\n\\n Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is\\nthine eye evil, because I am good?   So the last shall be first,\\nand the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.\\n\\n And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart\\nin the way, and said unto them,  Behold, we go up to Jerusalem;\\nand the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto\\nthe scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,  And shall\\ndeliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify\\nhim: and the third day he shall rise again.\\n\\n Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her sons,\\nworshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.\\n\\n And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant\\nthat these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the\\nother on the left, in thy kingdom.\\n\\n But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye\\nable to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized\\nwith the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are\\nable.\\n\\n And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be\\nbaptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my\\nright hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given\\nto them for whom it is prepared of my Father.\\n\\n And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation\\nagainst the two brethren.\\n\\n But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the\\nprinces of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are\\ngreat exercise authority upon them.\\n\\n But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great\\namong you, let him be your minister;  And whosoever will be chief\\namong you, let him be your servant:  Even as the Son of man came\\nnot to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a\\nransom for many.\\n\\n And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed\\nhim.\\n\\n And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they\\nheard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O\\nLord, thou son of David.\\n\\n And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their\\npeace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou\\nson of David.\\n\\n And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye\\nthat I shall do unto you?   They say unto him, Lord, that our\\neyes may be opened.\\n\\n So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and\\nimmediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.\\n\\n And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to\\nBethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,\\n Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and\\nstraightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose\\nthem, and bring them unto me.\\n\\n And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath\\nneed of them; and straightway he will send them.\\n\\n All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by\\nthe prophet, saying,  Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy\\nKing cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the\\nfoal of an ass.\\n\\n And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,  And\\nbrought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they\\nset him thereon.\\n\\n And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way;\\nothers cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way.\\n\\n And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried,\\nsaying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the\\nname of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.\\n\\n And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved,\\nsaying, Who is this?   And the multitude said, This is Jesus the\\nprophet of Nazareth of Galilee.\\n\\n And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them\\nthat sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the\\nmoneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,  And said\\nunto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of\\nprayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.\\n\\n And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he\\nhealed them.\\n\\n And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things\\nthat he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying,\\nHosanna to the son of David; they were sore displeased,  And said\\nunto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea;\\nhave ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast\\nperfected praise?   And he left them, and went out of the city\\ninto Bethany; and he lodged there.\\n\\n Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.\\n\\n And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found\\nnothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow\\non thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered\\naway.\\n\\n And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon\\nis the fig tree withered away!   Jesus answered and said unto\\nthem, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall\\nnot only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall\\nsay unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the\\nsea; it shall be done.\\n\\n And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye\\nshall receive.\\n\\n And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the\\nelders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By\\nwhat authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this\\nauthority?   And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will\\nask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you\\nby what authority I do these things.\\n\\n The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And\\nthey reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven;\\nhe will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?   But if we\\nshall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.\\n\\n And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said\\nunto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.\\n\\n But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to\\nthe first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.\\n\\n He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and\\nwent.\\n\\n And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered\\nand said, I go, sir: and went not.\\n\\n Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto\\nhim, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the\\npublicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.\\n\\n For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye\\nbelieved him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and\\nye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe\\nhim.\\n\\n Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which\\nplanted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress\\nin it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into\\na far country:  And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent\\nhis servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of\\nit.\\n\\n And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed\\nanother, and stoned another.\\n\\n Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did\\nunto them likewise.\\n\\n But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will\\nreverence my son.\\n\\n But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves,\\nThis is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his\\ninheritance.\\n\\n And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew\\nhim.\\n\\n When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do\\nunto those husbandmen?   They say unto him, He will miserably\\ndestroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other\\nhusbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.\\n\\n Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The\\nstone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the\\ncorner: this is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?\\n Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from\\nyou, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.\\n\\n And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on\\nwhomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.\\n\\n And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables,\\nthey perceived that he spake of them.\\n\\n But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the\\nmultitude, because they took him for a prophet.\\n\\n And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and\\nsaid,  The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which\\nmade a marriage for his son,  And sent forth his servants to call\\nthem that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.\\n\\n Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are\\nbidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are\\nkilled, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage.\\n\\n But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm,\\nanother to his merchandise:  And the remnant took his servants,\\nand entreated them spitefully, and slew them.\\n\\n But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth\\nhis armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.\\n\\n Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they\\nwhich were bidden were not worthy.\\n\\n Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find,\\nbid to the marriage.\\n\\n So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered\\ntogether all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding\\nwas furnished with guests.\\n\\n And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man\\nwhich had not on a wedding garment:  And he saith unto him,\\nFriend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he\\nwas speechless.\\n\\n Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and\\ntake him away, and cast him into outer darkness, there shall be\\nweeping and gnashing of teeth.\\n\\n For many are called, but few are chosen.\\n\\n Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might\\nentangle him in his talk.\\n\\n And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians,\\nsaying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of\\nGod in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not\\nthe person of men.\\n\\n Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give\\ntribute unto Caesar, or not?   But Jesus perceived their\\nwickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?   Shew me\\nthe tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.\\n\\n And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?\\n They say unto him, Caesar’s. Then saith he unto them, Render\\ntherefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s; and unto God the\\nthings that are God’s.\\n\\n When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him,\\nand went their way.\\n\\n The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is\\nno resurrection, and asked him,  Saying, Master, Moses said, If a\\nman die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and\\nraise up seed unto his brother.\\n\\n Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he\\nhad married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto\\nhis brother:  Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the\\nseventh.\\n\\n And last of all the woman died also.\\n\\n Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the\\nseven?  for they all had her.\\n\\n Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the\\nscriptures, nor the power of God.\\n\\n For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in\\nmarriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.\\n\\n But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read\\nthat which was spoken unto you by God, saying,  I am the God of\\nAbraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?  God is not the\\nGod of the dead, but of the living.\\n\\n And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his\\ndoctrine.\\n\\n But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees\\nto silence, they were gathered together.\\n\\n Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question,\\ntempting him, and saying,  Master, which is the great commandment\\nin the law?   Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy\\nGod with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.\\n\\n This is the first and great commandment.\\n\\n And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as\\nthyself.\\n\\n On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.\\n\\n While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,\\n Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto\\nhim, The son of David.\\n\\n He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord,\\nsaying,  The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,\\ntill I make thine enemies thy footstool?   If David then call him\\nLord, how is he his son?   And no man was able to answer him a\\nword, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more\\nquestions.\\n\\n Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, \\nSaying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat:  All\\ntherefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do\\nnot ye after their works: for they say, and do not.\\n\\n For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay\\nthem on men’s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with\\none of their fingers.\\n\\n But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make\\nbroad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,\\n And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in\\nthe synagogues,  And greetings in the markets, and to be called of\\nmen, Rabbi, Rabbi.\\n\\n But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ;\\nand all ye are brethren.\\n\\n And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your\\nFather, which is in heaven.\\n\\n Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even\\nChrist.\\n\\n But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.\\n\\n And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that\\nshall humble himself shall be exalted.\\n\\n But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut\\nup the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves,\\nneither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.\\n\\n Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour\\nwidows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye\\nshall receive the greater damnation.\\n\\n Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass\\nsea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him\\ntwofold more the child of hell than yourselves.\\n\\n Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear\\nby the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of\\nthe temple, he is a debtor!   Ye fools and blind: for whether is\\ngreater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?  \\nAnd, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever\\nsweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty.\\n\\n Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the\\naltar that sanctifieth the gift?   Whoso therefore shall swear by\\nthe altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon.\\n\\n And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him\\nthat dwelleth therein.\\n\\n And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of\\nGod, and by him that sitteth thereon.\\n\\n Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay\\ntithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier\\nmatters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have\\ndone, and not to leave the other undone.\\n\\n Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.\\n\\n Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make\\nclean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are\\nfull of extortion and excess.\\n\\n Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup\\nand platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.\\n\\n Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like\\nunto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are\\nwithin full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness.\\n\\n Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within\\nye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.\\n\\n Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye\\nbuild the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the\\nrighteous,  And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers,\\nwe would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the\\nprophets.\\n\\n Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the\\nchildren of them which killed the prophets.\\n\\n Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.\\n\\n Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the\\ndamnation of hell?   Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets,\\nand wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify;\\nand some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute\\nthem from city to city:  That upon you may come all the righteous\\nblood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the\\nblood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple\\nand the altar.\\n\\n Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this\\ngeneration.\\n\\n O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and\\nstonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered\\nthy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her\\nwings, and ye would not!   Behold, your house is left unto you\\ndesolate.\\n\\n For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye\\nshall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.\\n\\n And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his\\ndisciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple.\\n\\n And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I\\nsay unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another,\\nthat shall not be thrown down.\\n\\n And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto\\nhim privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what\\nshall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?  \\nAnd Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive\\nyou.\\n\\n For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall\\ndeceive many.\\n\\n And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not\\ntroubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not\\nyet.\\n\\n For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against\\nkingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes,\\nin divers places.\\n\\n All these are the beginning of sorrows.\\n\\n Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill\\nyou: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.\\n\\n And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another,\\nand shall hate one another.\\n\\n And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.\\n\\n And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax\\ncold.\\n\\n But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.\\n\\n And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the\\nworld for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.\\n\\n When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation,\\nspoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso\\nreadeth, let him understand:)  Then let them which be in Judaea\\nflee into the mountains:  Let him which is on the housetop not\\ncome down to take any thing out of his house:  Neither let him\\nwhich is in the field return back to take his clothes.\\n\\n And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give\\nsuck in those days!   But pray ye that your flight be not in the\\nwinter, neither on the sabbath day:  For then shall be great\\ntribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this\\ntime, no, nor ever shall be.\\n\\n And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh\\nbe saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened.\\n\\n Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or\\nthere; believe it not.\\n\\n For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and\\nshall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were\\npossible, they shall deceive the very elect.\\n\\n Behold, I have told you before.\\n\\n Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the\\ndesert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it\\nnot.\\n\\n For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even\\nunto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.\\n\\n For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be\\ngathered together.\\n\\n Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be\\ndarkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall\\nfall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: \\nAnd then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then\\nshall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of\\nman coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.\\n\\n And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet,\\nand they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one\\nend of heaven to the other.\\n\\n Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet\\ntender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh: \\nSo likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is\\nnear, even at the doors.\\n\\n Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all\\nthese things be fulfilled.\\n\\n Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass\\naway.\\n\\n But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of\\nheaven, but my Father only.\\n\\n But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son\\nof man be.\\n\\n For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating\\nand drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe\\nentered into the ark,  And knew not until the flood came, and\\ntook them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.\\n\\n Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the\\nother left.\\n\\n Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken,\\nand the other left.\\n\\n Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.\\n\\n But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in\\nwhat watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not\\nhave suffered his house to be broken up.\\n\\n Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not\\nthe Son of man cometh.\\n\\n Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made\\nruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?  \\nBlessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so\\ndoing.\\n\\n Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his\\ngoods.\\n\\n But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord\\ndelayeth his coming;  And shall begin to smite his\\nfellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;  The lord\\nof that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and\\nin an hour that he is not aware of,  And shall cut him asunder,\\nand appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be\\nweeping and gnashing of teeth.\\n\\n Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins,\\nwhich took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.\\n\\n And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.\\n\\n They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with\\nthem:  But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.\\n\\n While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.\\n\\n And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom\\ncometh; go ye out to meet him.\\n\\n Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.\\n\\n And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our\\nlamps are gone out.\\n\\n But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough\\nfor us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for\\nyourselves.\\n\\n And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that\\nwere ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.\\n\\n Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open\\nto us.\\n\\n But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.\\n\\n Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour\\nwherein the Son of man cometh.\\n\\n For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far\\ncountry, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his\\ngoods.\\n\\n And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to\\nanother one; to every man according to his several ability; and\\nstraightway took his journey.\\n\\n Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with\\nthe same, and made them other five talents.\\n\\n And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.\\n\\n But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and\\nhid his lord’s money.\\n\\n After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and\\nreckoneth with them.\\n\\n And so he that had received five talents came and brought other\\nfive talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents:\\nbehold, I have gained beside them five talents more.\\n\\n His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful\\nservant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee\\nruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.\\n\\n He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou\\ndeliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other\\ntalents beside them.\\n\\n His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant;\\nthou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over\\nmany things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.\\n\\n Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I\\nknew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown,\\nand gathering where thou hast not strawed:  And I was afraid, and\\nwent and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is\\nthine.\\n\\n His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful\\nservant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where\\nI have not strawed:  Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money\\nto the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine\\nown with usury.\\n\\n Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which\\nhath ten talents.\\n\\n For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have\\nabundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that\\nwhich he hath.\\n\\n And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there\\nshall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\\n\\n When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy\\nangels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: \\nAnd before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate\\nthem one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the\\ngoats:  And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the\\ngoats on the left.\\n\\n Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye\\nblessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the\\nfoundation of the world:  For I was an hungred, and ye gave me\\nmeat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye\\ntook me in:  Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited\\nme: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.\\n\\n Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we\\nthee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?  \\nWhen saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed\\nthee?   Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto\\nthee?   And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say\\nunto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these\\nmy brethren, ye have done it unto me.\\n\\n Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from\\nme, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his\\nangels:  For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was\\nthirsty, and ye gave me no drink:  I was a stranger, and ye took\\nme not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye\\nvisited me not.\\n\\n Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee\\nan hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in\\nprison, and did not minister unto thee?   Then shall he answer\\nthem, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one\\nof the least of these, ye did it not to me.\\n\\n And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the\\nrighteous into life eternal.\\n\\n And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings,\\nhe said unto his disciples,  Ye know that after two days is the\\nfeast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.\\n\\n Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and\\nthe elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was\\ncalled Caiaphas,  And consulted that they might take Jesus by\\nsubtilty, and kill him.\\n\\n But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar\\namong the people.\\n\\n Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,\\n There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very\\nprecious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.\\n\\n But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To\\nwhat purpose is this waste?   For this ointment might have been\\nsold for much, and given to the poor.\\n\\n When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the\\nwoman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.\\n\\n For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.\\n\\n For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it\\nfor my burial.\\n\\n Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached\\nin the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done,\\nbe told for a memorial of her.\\n\\n Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the\\nchief priests,  And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I\\nwill deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty\\npieces of silver.\\n\\n And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.\\n\\n Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples\\ncame to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for\\nthee to eat the passover?   And he said, Go into the city to such\\na man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will\\nkeep the passover at thy house with my disciples.\\n\\n And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made\\nready the passover.\\n\\n Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.\\n\\n And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of\\nyou shall betray me.\\n\\n And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them\\nto say unto him, Lord, is it I?   And he answered and said, He\\nthat dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.\\n\\n The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that\\nman by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man\\nif he had not been born.\\n\\n Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it\\nI?  He said unto him, Thou hast said.\\n\\n And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and\\nbrake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is\\nmy body.\\n\\n And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them,\\nsaying, Drink ye all of it;  For this is my blood of the new\\ntestament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.\\n\\n But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of\\nthe vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s\\nkingdom.\\n\\n And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of\\nOlives.\\n\\n Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of\\nme this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the\\nsheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.\\n\\n But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.\\n\\n Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be\\noffended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.\\n\\n Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night,\\nbefore the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.\\n\\n Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I\\nnot deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.\\n\\n Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and\\nsaith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.\\n\\n And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and\\nbegan to be sorrowful and very heavy.\\n\\n Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even\\nunto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.\\n\\n And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed,\\nsaying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me:\\nnevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.\\n\\n And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and\\nsaith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?  \\nWatch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed\\nis willing, but the flesh is weak.\\n\\n He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my\\nFather, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy\\nwill be done.\\n\\n And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were\\nheavy.\\n\\n And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third\\ntime, saying the same words.\\n\\n Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on\\nnow, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of\\nman is betrayed into the hands of sinners.\\n\\n Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray\\nme.\\n\\n And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and\\nwith him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief\\npriests and elders of the people.\\n\\n Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I\\nshall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.\\n\\n And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and\\nkissed him.\\n\\n And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then\\ncame they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him.\\n\\n And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his\\nhand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest’s,\\nand smote off his ear.\\n\\n Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place:\\nfor all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.\\n\\n Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall\\npresently give me more than twelve legions of angels?   But how\\nthen shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?  \\nIn that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as\\nagainst a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily\\nwith you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.\\n\\n But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might\\nbe fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.\\n\\n And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas\\nthe high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.\\n\\n But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest’s palace,\\nand went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.\\n\\n Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought\\nfalse witness against Jesus, to put him to death;  But found\\nnone: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At\\nthe last came two false witnesses,  And said, This fellow said, I\\nam able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.\\n\\n And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou\\nnothing? what is it which these witness against thee?   But Jesus\\nheld his peace, And the high priest answered and said unto him, I\\nadjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the\\nChrist, the Son of God.\\n\\n Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto\\nyou, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand\\nof power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.\\n\\n Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken\\nblasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have\\nheard his blasphemy.\\n\\n What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.\\n\\n Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others\\nsmote him with the palms of their hands,  Saying, Prophesy unto\\nus, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?   Now Peter sat\\nwithout in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also\\nwast with Jesus of Galilee.\\n\\n But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou\\nsayest.\\n\\n And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him,\\nand said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of\\nNazareth.\\n\\n And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.\\n\\n And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to\\nPeter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth\\nthee.\\n\\n Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man.\\nAnd immediately the cock crew.\\n\\n And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him,\\nBefore the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and\\nwept bitterly.\\n\\n When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of\\nthe people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:  And\\nwhen they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to\\nPontius Pilate the governor.\\n\\n Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was\\ncondemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of\\nsilver to the chief priests and elders,  Saying, I have sinned in\\nthat I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that\\nto us? see thou to that.\\n\\n And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and\\ndeparted, and went and hanged himself.\\n\\n And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not\\nlawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of\\nblood.\\n\\n And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field,\\nto bury strangers in.\\n\\n Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this\\nday.\\n\\n Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet,\\nsaying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him\\nthat was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value; \\nAnd gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me.\\n\\n And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him,\\nsaying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou\\nsayest.\\n\\n And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he\\nanswered nothing.\\n\\n Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they\\nwitness against thee?   And he answered him to never a word;\\ninsomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.\\n\\n Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the\\npeople a prisoner, whom they would.\\n\\n And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.\\n\\n Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto\\nthem, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which\\nis called Christ?   For he knew that for envy they had delivered\\nhim.\\n\\n When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto\\nhim, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have\\nsuffered many things this day in a dream because of him.\\n\\n But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that\\nthey should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.\\n\\n The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain\\nwill ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.\\n\\n Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is\\ncalled Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.\\n\\n And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they\\ncried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.\\n\\n When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a\\ntumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the\\nmultitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see\\nye to it.\\n\\n Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and\\non our children.\\n\\n Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged\\nJesus, he delivered him to be crucified.\\n\\n Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common\\nhall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.\\n\\n And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.\\n\\n And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon\\nhis head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before\\nhim, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!   And they\\nspit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.\\n\\n And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from\\nhim, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.\\n\\n And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name:\\nhim they compelled to bear his cross.\\n\\n And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to\\nsay, a place of a skull,  They gave him vinegar to drink mingled\\nwith gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.\\n\\n And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots:\\nthat it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They\\nparted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.\\n\\n And sitting down they watched him there;  And set up over\\nhis head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.\\n\\n Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right\\nhand, and another on the left.\\n\\n And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads, \\nAnd saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three\\ndays, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the\\ncross.\\n\\n Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes\\nand elders, said,  He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he\\nbe the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we\\nwill believe him.\\n\\n He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him:\\nfor he said, I am the Son of God.\\n\\n The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same\\nin his teeth.\\n\\n Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land\\nunto the ninth hour.\\n\\n And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,\\nEli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast\\nthou forsaken me?   Some of them that stood there, when they\\nheard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.\\n\\n And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled\\nit with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.\\n\\n The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to\\nsave him.\\n\\n Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the\\nghost.\\n\\n And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the\\ntop to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent; \\nAnd the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept\\narose,  And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and\\nwent into the holy city, and appeared unto many.\\n\\n Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching\\nJesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they\\nfeared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.\\n\\n And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed\\nJesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:  Among which was Mary\\nMagdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of\\nZebedees children.\\n\\n When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea,\\nnamed Joseph, who also himself was Jesus’ disciple:  He went to\\nPilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body\\nto be delivered.\\n\\n And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean\\nlinen cloth,  And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn\\nout in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the\\nsepulchre, and departed.\\n\\n And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over\\nagainst the sepulchre.\\n\\n Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the\\nchief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,  Saying,\\nSir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive,\\nAfter three days I will rise again.\\n\\n Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the\\nthird day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and\\nsay unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error\\nshall be worse than the first.\\n\\n Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as\\nsure as ye can.\\n\\n So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone,\\nand setting a watch.\\n\\n In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first\\nday of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the\\nsepulchre.\\n\\n And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the\\nLord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from\\nthe door, and sat upon it.\\n\\n His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as\\nsnow:  And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as\\ndead men.\\n\\n And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for\\nI know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.\\n\\n He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place\\nwhere the Lord lay.\\n\\n And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the\\ndead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye\\nsee him: lo, I have told you.\\n\\n And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great\\njoy; and did run to bring his disciples word.\\n\\n And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them,\\nsaying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and\\nworshipped him.\\n\\n Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren\\nthat they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.\\n\\n Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into\\nthe city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were\\ndone.\\n\\n And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken\\ncounsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,  Saying, Say\\nye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.\\n\\n And if this come to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him,\\nand secure you.\\n\\n So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this\\nsaying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.\\n\\n Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a\\nmountain where Jesus had appointed them.\\n\\n And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.\\n\\n And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given\\nunto me in heaven and in earth.\\n\\n Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the\\nname of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: \\nTeaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you:\\nand, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " ' The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God; \\nAs it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before\\nthy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.\\n\\n The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of\\nthe Lord, make his paths straight.\\n\\n John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of\\nrepentance for the remission of sins.\\n\\n And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of\\nJerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan,\\nconfessing their sins.\\n\\n And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and with a girdle of a\\nskin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;  And\\npreached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the\\nlatchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.\\n\\n I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you\\nwith the Holy Ghost.\\n\\n And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth\\nof Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.\\n\\n And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens\\nopened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:  And there\\ncame a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I\\nam well pleased.\\n\\n And immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness.\\n\\n And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan;\\nand was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.\\n\\n Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee,\\npreaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,  And saying, The time\\nis fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and\\nbelieve the gospel.\\n\\n Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew\\nhis brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.\\n\\n And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you\\nto become fishers of men.\\n\\n And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.\\n\\n And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the\\nson of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship\\nmending their nets.\\n\\n And straightway he called them: and they left their father\\nZebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.\\n\\n And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day\\nhe entered into the synagogue, and taught.\\n\\n And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as\\none that had authority, and not as the scribes.\\n\\n And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit;\\nand he cried out,  Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with\\nthee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee\\nwho thou art, the Holy One of God.\\n\\n And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of\\nhim.\\n\\n And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud\\nvoice, he came out of him.\\n\\n And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among\\nthemselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for\\nwith authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do\\nobey him.\\n\\n And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region\\nround about Galilee.\\n\\n And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they\\nentered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.\\n\\n But Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell\\nhim of her.\\n\\n And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and\\nimmediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.\\n\\n And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that\\nwere diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.\\n\\n And all the city was gathered together at the door.\\n\\n And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast\\nout many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they\\nknew him.\\n\\n And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went\\nout, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.\\n\\n And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.\\n\\n And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for\\nthee.\\n\\n And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may\\npreach there also: for therefore came I forth.\\n\\n And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and\\ncast out devils.\\n\\n And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down\\nto him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.\\n\\n And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched\\nhim, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.\\n\\n And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed\\nfrom him, and he was cleansed.\\n\\n And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away; \\nAnd saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way,\\nshew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things\\nwhich Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.\\n\\n But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze\\nabroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into\\nthe city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from\\nevery quarter.\\n\\n And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was\\nnoised that he was in the house.\\n\\n And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there\\nwas no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he\\npreached the word unto them.\\n\\n And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was\\nborne of four.\\n\\n And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they\\nuncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they\\nlet down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.\\n\\n When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy,\\nSon, thy sins be forgiven thee.\\n\\n But there was certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning\\nin their hearts,  Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can\\nforgive sins but God only?   And immediately when Jesus perceived\\nin his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto\\nthem, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?   Whether is it\\neasier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or\\nto say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?   But that ye may\\nknow that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he\\nsaith to the sick of the palsy,)  I say unto thee, Arise, and take\\nup thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.\\n\\n And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before\\nthem all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God,\\nsaying, We never saw it on this fashion.\\n\\n And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude\\nresorted unto him, and he taught them.\\n\\n And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at\\nthe receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and\\nfollowed him.\\n\\n And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house,\\nmany publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his\\ndisciples: for there were many, and they followed him.\\n\\n And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and\\nsinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and\\ndrinketh with publicans and sinners?   When Jesus heard it, he\\nsaith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician,\\nbut they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners\\nto repentance.\\n\\n And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and\\nthey come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the\\nPharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?   And Jesus said unto\\nthem, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom\\nis with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they\\ncannot fast.\\n\\n But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away\\nfrom them, and then shall they fast in those days.\\n\\n No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else\\nthe new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent\\nis made worse.\\n\\n And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine\\ndoth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will\\nbe marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.\\n\\n And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the\\nsabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears\\nof corn.\\n\\n And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the\\nsabbath day that which is not lawful?   And he said unto them,\\nHave ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an\\nhungred, he, and they that were with him?   How he went into the\\nhouse of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the\\nshewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave\\nalso to them which were with him?   And he said unto them, The\\nsabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:  Therefore\\nthe Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.\\n\\n And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there\\nwhich had a withered hand.\\n\\n And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath\\nday; that they might accuse him.\\n\\n And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand\\nforth.\\n\\n And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath\\ndays, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their\\npeace.\\n\\n And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being\\ngrieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man,\\nStretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was\\nrestored whole as the other.\\n\\n And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with\\nthe Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.\\n\\n But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a\\ngreat multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,  And\\nfrom Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they\\nabout Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what\\ngreat things he did, came unto him.\\n\\n And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on\\nhim because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.\\n\\n For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for\\nto touch him, as many as had plagues.\\n\\n And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and\\ncried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.\\n\\n And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.\\n\\n And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he\\nwould: and they came unto him.\\n\\n And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he\\nmight send them forth to preach,  And to have power to heal\\nsicknesses, and to cast out devils:  And Simon he surnamed Peter;\\n And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and\\nhe surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:  And\\nAndrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and\\nJames the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,\\n And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into\\nan house.\\n\\n And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not\\nso much as eat bread.\\n\\n And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on\\nhim: for they said, He is beside himself.\\n\\n And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath\\nBeelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.\\n\\n And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How\\ncan Satan cast out Satan?   And if a kingdom be divided against\\nitself, that kingdom cannot stand.\\n\\n And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot\\nstand.\\n\\n And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot\\nstand, but hath an end.\\n\\n No man can enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil his goods,\\nexcept he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his\\nhouse.\\n\\n Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons\\nof men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme: \\nBut he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never\\nforgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation.\\n\\n Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.\\n\\n There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing\\nwithout, sent unto him, calling him.\\n\\n And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold,\\nthy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.\\n\\n And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?\\n And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said,\\nBehold my mother and my brethren!   For whosoever shall do the\\nwill of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.\\n\\n And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was\\ngathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship,\\nand sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the\\nland.\\n\\n And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in\\nhis doctrine,  Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow: \\nAnd it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the\\nfowls of the air came and devoured it up.\\n\\n And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and\\nimmediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:  But\\nwhen the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it\\nwithered away.\\n\\n And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it,\\nand it yielded no fruit.\\n\\n And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up\\nand increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and\\nsome an hundred.\\n\\n And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.\\n\\n And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve\\nasked of him the parable.\\n\\n And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery\\nof the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these\\nthings are done in parables:  That seeing they may see, and not\\nperceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any\\ntime they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.\\n\\n And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then\\nwill ye know all parables?   The sower soweth the word.\\n\\n And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but\\nwhen they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the\\nword that was sown in their hearts.\\n\\n And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who,\\nwhen they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;\\n And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time:\\nafterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word’s sake,\\nimmediately they are offended.\\n\\n And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the\\nword,  And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of\\nriches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and\\nit becometh unfruitful.\\n\\n And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear\\nthe word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some\\nsixty, and some an hundred.\\n\\n And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a\\nbushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?   For\\nthere is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any\\nthing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.\\n\\n If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.\\n\\n And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure\\nye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall\\nmore be given.\\n\\n For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not,\\nfrom him shall be taken even that which he hath.\\n\\n And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast\\nseed into the ground;  And should sleep, and rise night and day,\\nand the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.\\n\\n For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade,\\nthen the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.\\n\\n But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in\\nthe sickle, because the harvest is come.\\n\\n And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with\\nwhat comparison shall we compare it?   It is like a grain of\\nmustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all\\nthe seeds that be in the earth:  But when it is sown, it groweth\\nup, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great\\nbranches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of\\nit.\\n\\n And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they\\nwere able to hear it.\\n\\n But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were\\nalone, he expounded all things to his disciples.\\n\\n And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let\\nus pass over unto the other side.\\n\\n And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as\\nhe was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.\\n\\n And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into\\nthe ship, so that it was now full.\\n\\n And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow:\\nand they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we\\nperish?   And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the\\nsea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.\\n\\n And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye\\nhave no faith?   And they feared exceedingly, and said one to\\nanother, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea\\nobey him?   And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into\\nthe country of the Gadarenes.\\n\\n And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him\\nout of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,  Who had his\\ndwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with\\nchains:  Because that he had been often bound with fetters and\\nchains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the\\nfetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.\\n\\n And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the\\ntombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.\\n\\n But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,  And\\ncried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus,\\nthou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment\\nme not.\\n\\n For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.\\n\\n And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My\\nname is Legion: for we are many.\\n\\n And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of\\nthe country.\\n\\n Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine\\nfeeding.\\n\\n And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine,\\nthat we may enter into them.\\n\\n And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went\\nout, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a\\nsteep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were\\nchoked in the sea.\\n\\n And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in\\nthe country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.\\n\\n And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the\\ndevil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right\\nmind: and they were afraid.\\n\\n And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was\\npossessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine.\\n\\n And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.\\n\\n And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed\\nwith the devil prayed him that he might be with him.\\n\\n Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to\\nthy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for\\nthee, and hath had compassion on thee.\\n\\n And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great\\nthings Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel.\\n\\n And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side,\\nmuch people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea.\\n\\n And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue,\\nJairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,  And\\nbesought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of\\ndeath: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be\\nhealed; and she shall live.\\n\\n And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and\\nthronged him.\\n\\n And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,\\n And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent\\nall that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,\\n When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and\\ntouched his garment.\\n\\n For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.\\n\\n And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she\\nfelt in her body that she was healed of that plague.\\n\\n And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone\\nout of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my\\nclothes?   And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the\\nmultitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?   And\\nhe looked round about to see her that had done this thing.\\n\\n But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in\\nher, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.\\n\\n And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole;\\ngo in peace, and be whole of thy plague.\\n\\n While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue’s\\nhouse certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the\\nMaster any further?   As soon as Jesus heard the word that was\\nspoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only\\nbelieve.\\n\\n And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and\\nJohn the brother of James.\\n\\n And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and\\nseeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.\\n\\n And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this\\nado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.\\n\\n And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out,\\nhe taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were\\nwith him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.\\n\\n And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha\\ncumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.\\n\\n And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the\\nage of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great\\nastonishment.\\n\\n And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and\\ncommanded that something should be given her to eat.\\n\\n And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and\\nhis disciples follow him.\\n\\n And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the\\nsynagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence\\nhath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given\\nunto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?  \\nIs not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and\\nJoses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us?\\nAnd they were offended at him.\\n\\n But Jesus, said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in\\nhis own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.\\n\\n And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands\\nupon a few sick folk, and healed them.\\n\\n And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round\\nabout the villages, teaching.\\n\\n And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by\\ntwo and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;  And\\ncommanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a\\nstaff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse:  But be\\nshod with sandals; and not put on two coats.\\n\\n And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an\\nhouse, there abide till ye depart from that place.\\n\\n And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart\\nthence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against\\nthem.\\n\\nVerily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and\\nGomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.\\n\\n And they went out, and preached that men should repent.\\n\\n And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that\\nwere sick, and healed them.\\n\\n And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:)\\nand he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and\\ntherefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.\\n\\n Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a\\nprophet, or as one of the prophets.\\n\\n But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I\\nbeheaded: he is risen from the dead.\\n\\n For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and\\nbound him in prison for Herodias’ sake, his brother Philip’s wife: for\\nhe had married her.\\n\\n For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have\\nthy brother’s wife.\\n\\n Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have\\nkilled him; but she could not:  For Herod feared John, knowing\\nthat he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he\\nheard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.\\n\\n And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday\\nmade a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of\\nGalilee;  And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and\\ndanced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said\\nunto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it\\nthee.\\n\\n And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will\\ngive it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.\\n\\n And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask?\\nAnd she said, The head of John the Baptist.\\n\\n And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked,\\nsaying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of\\nJohn the Baptist.\\n\\n And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath’s sake, and\\nfor their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.\\n\\n And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his\\nhead to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison, \\nAnd brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the\\ndamsel gave it to her mother.\\n\\n And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his\\ncorpse, and laid it in a tomb.\\n\\n And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and\\ntold him all things, both what they had done, and what they had\\ntaught.\\n\\n And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert\\nplace, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and\\nthey had no leisure so much as to eat.\\n\\n And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.\\n\\n And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran\\nafoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together\\nunto him.\\n\\n And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with\\ncompassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a\\nshepherd: and he began to teach them many things.\\n\\n And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him,\\nand said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed: \\nSend them away, that they may go into the country round about, and\\ninto the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to\\neat.\\n\\n He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say\\nunto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and\\ngive them to eat?   He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye?\\ngo and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.\\n\\n And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the\\ngreen grass.\\n\\n And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.\\n\\n And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he\\nlooked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them\\nto his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he\\namong them all.\\n\\n And they did all eat, and were filled.\\n\\n And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the\\nfishes.\\n\\n And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.\\n\\n And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the\\nship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent\\naway the people.\\n\\n And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to\\npray.\\n\\n And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and\\nhe alone on the land.\\n\\n And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto\\nthem: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them,\\nwalking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.\\n\\n But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had\\nbeen a spirit, and cried out:  For they all saw him, and were\\ntroubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be\\nof good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.\\n\\n And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and\\nthey were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.\\n\\n For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their\\nheart was hardened.\\n\\n And when they had passed over, they came into the land of\\nGennesaret, and drew to the shore.\\n\\n And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew\\nhim,  And ran through that whole region round about, and began to\\ncarry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.\\n\\n And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or\\ncountry, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they\\nmight touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as\\ntouched him were made whole.\\n\\n Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the\\nscribes, which came from Jerusalem.\\n\\n And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled,\\nthat is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.\\n\\n For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands\\noft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.\\n\\n And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat\\nnot.\\n\\nAnd many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as\\nthe washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.\\n\\n Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy\\ndisciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with\\nunwashen hands?   He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias\\nprophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth\\nme with their lips, but their heart is far from me.\\n\\n Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the\\ncommandments of men.\\n\\n For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of\\nmen, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things\\nye do.\\n\\n And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God,\\nthat ye may keep your own tradition.\\n\\n For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso\\ncurseth father or mother, let him die the death:  But ye say, If a\\nman shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a\\ngift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.\\n\\n And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his\\nmother;  Making the word of God of none effect through your\\ntradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.\\n\\n And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto\\nthem, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:  There is\\nnothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but\\nthe things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.\\n\\n If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.\\n\\n And when he was entered into the house from the people, his\\ndisciples asked him concerning the parable.\\n\\n And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do\\nye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the\\nman, it cannot defile him;  Because it entereth not into his\\nheart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all\\nmeats?   And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that\\ndefileth the man.\\n\\n For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts,\\nadulteries, fornications, murders,  Thefts, covetousness,\\nwickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride,\\nfoolishness:  All these evil things come from within, and defile\\nthe man.\\n\\n And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and\\nSidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but\\nhe could not be hid.\\n\\n For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit,\\nheard of him, and came and fell at his feet:  The woman was a\\nGreek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would\\ncast forth the devil out of her daughter.\\n\\n But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it\\nis not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast it unto the\\ndogs.\\n\\n And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under\\nthe table eat of the children’s crumbs.\\n\\n And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is\\ngone out of thy daughter.\\n\\n And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out,\\nand her daughter laid upon the bed.\\n\\n And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came\\nunto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.\\n\\n And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment\\nin his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.\\n\\n And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers\\ninto his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;  And looking\\nup to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be\\nopened.\\n\\n And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his\\ntongue was loosed, and he spake plain.\\n\\n And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he\\ncharged them, so much the more a great deal they published it; \\nAnd were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things\\nwell: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.\\n\\n In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing\\nto eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them, \\nI have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me\\nthree days, and have nothing to eat:  And if I send them away\\nfasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of\\nthem came from far.\\n\\n And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy\\nthese men with bread here in the wilderness?   And he asked them,\\nHow many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.\\n\\n And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took\\nthe seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his\\ndisciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people.\\n\\n And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to\\nset them also before them.\\n\\n So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken\\nmeat that was left seven baskets.\\n\\n And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them\\naway.\\n\\n And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and\\ncame into the parts of Dalmanutha.\\n\\n And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him,\\nseeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.\\n\\n And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this\\ngeneration seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no\\nsign be given unto this generation.\\n\\n And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to\\nthe other side.\\n\\n Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they\\nin the ship with them more than one loaf.\\n\\n And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of\\nthe Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.\\n\\n And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have\\nno bread.\\n\\n And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye,\\nbecause ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand?\\nhave ye your heart yet hardened?   Having eyes, see ye not? and\\nhaving ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?   When I brake\\nthe five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of\\nfragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.\\n\\n And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of\\nfragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.\\n\\n And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?  \\nAnd he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and\\nbesought him to touch him.\\n\\n And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the\\ntown; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he\\nasked him if he saw ought.\\n\\n And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.\\n\\n After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him\\nlook up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.\\n\\n And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the\\ntown, nor tell it to any in the town.\\n\\n And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea\\nPhilippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them,\\nWhom do men say that I am?   And they answered, John the Baptist;\\nbut some say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.\\n\\n And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter\\nanswereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.\\n\\n And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.\\n\\n And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many\\nthings, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and\\nscribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.\\n\\n And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to\\nrebuke him.\\n\\n But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he\\nrebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest\\nnot the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.\\n\\n And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples\\nalso, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny\\nhimself, and take up his cross, and follow me.\\n\\n For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever\\nshall lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s, the same shall save\\nit.\\n\\n For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world,\\nand lose his own soul?   Or what shall a man give in exchange for\\nhis soul?   Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my\\nwords in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the\\nSon of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with\\nthe holy angels.\\n\\n And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some\\nof them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they\\nhave seen the kingdom of God come with power.\\n\\n And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and\\nJohn, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves:\\nand he was transfigured before them.\\n\\n And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no\\nfuller on earth can white them.\\n\\n And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were\\ntalking with Jesus.\\n\\n And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to\\nbe here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for\\nMoses, and one for Elias.\\n\\n For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.\\n\\n And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out\\nof the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.\\n\\n And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man\\nany more, save Jesus only with themselves.\\n\\n And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they\\nshould tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were\\nrisen from the dead.\\n\\n And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with\\nanother what the rising from the dead should mean.\\n\\n And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must\\nfirst come?   And he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh\\nfirst, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of\\nman, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought.\\n\\n But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done\\nunto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.\\n\\n And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about\\nthem, and the scribes questioning with them.\\n\\n And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were\\ngreatly amazed, and running to him saluted him.\\n\\n And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?   And\\none of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto\\nthee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;  And wheresoever he taketh\\nhim, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and\\npineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him\\nout; and they could not.\\n\\n He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long\\nshall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me.\\n\\n And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway\\nthe spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.\\n\\n And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto\\nhim?  And he said, Of a child.\\n\\n And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters,\\nto destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us,\\nand help us.\\n\\n Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are\\npossible to him that believeth.\\n\\n And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with\\ntears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.\\n\\n When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked\\nthe foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge\\nthee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.\\n\\n And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and\\nhe was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.\\n\\n But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.\\n\\n And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him\\nprivately, Why could not we cast him out?   And he said unto them,\\nThis kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.\\n\\n And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he\\nwould not that any man should know it.\\n\\n For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man\\nis delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after\\nthat he is killed, he shall rise the third day.\\n\\n But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.\\n\\n And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them,\\nWhat was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?   But\\nthey held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among\\nthemselves, who should be the greatest.\\n\\n And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If\\nany man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant\\nof all.\\n\\n And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when\\nhe had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,  Whosoever shall\\nreceive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever\\nshall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.\\n\\n And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out\\ndevils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him,\\nbecause he followeth not us.\\n\\n But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall\\ndo a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.\\n\\n For he that is not against us is on our part.\\n\\n For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name,\\nbecause ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose\\nhis reward.\\n\\n And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe\\nin me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his\\nneck, and he were cast into the sea.\\n\\n And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to\\nenter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into\\nthe fire that never shall be quenched:  Where their worm dieth\\nnot, and the fire is not quenched.\\n\\n And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to\\nenter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into\\nthe fire that never shall be quenched:  Where their worm dieth\\nnot, and the fire is not quenched.\\n\\n And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee\\nto enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to\\nbe cast into hell fire:  Where their worm dieth not, and the fire\\nis not quenched.\\n\\n For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice\\nshall be salted with salt.\\n\\n Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith\\nwill ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with\\nanother.\\n\\n And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by\\nthe farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him again; and,\\nas he was wont, he taught them again.\\n\\n And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a\\nman to put away his wife? tempting him.\\n\\n And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?\\n And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and\\nto put her away.\\n\\n And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your\\nheart he wrote you this precept.\\n\\n But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and\\nfemale.\\n\\n For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and\\ncleave to his wife;  And they twain shall be one flesh: so then\\nthey are no more twain, but one flesh.\\n\\n What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.\\n\\n And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same\\nmatter.\\n\\n And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and\\nmarry another, committeth adultery against her.\\n\\n And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to\\nanother, she committeth adultery.\\n\\n And they brought young children to him, that he should touch\\nthem: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.\\n\\n But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto\\nthem, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not:\\nfor of such is the kingdom of God.\\n\\n Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom\\nof God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.\\n\\n And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and\\nblessed them.\\n\\n And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running,\\nand kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I\\nmay inherit eternal life?   And Jesus said unto him, Why callest\\nthou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God.\\n\\n Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not\\nkill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy\\nfather and mother.   And he answered and said unto him, Master,\\nall these have I observed from my youth.\\n\\n Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing\\nthou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the\\npoor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the\\ncross, and follow me.\\n\\n And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had\\ngreat possessions.\\n\\n And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How\\nhardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!\\n And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus\\nanswereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for\\nthem that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!   It\\nis easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a\\nrich man to enter into the kingdom of God.\\n\\n And they were astonished out of measure, saying among\\nthemselves, Who then can be saved?   And Jesus looking upon them\\nsaith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all\\nthings are possible.\\n\\n Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have\\nfollowed thee.\\n\\n And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no\\nman that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or\\nmother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel’s,\\n But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses,\\nand brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with\\npersecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.\\n\\n But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.\\n\\n And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went\\nbefore them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were\\nafraid.\\n\\nAnd he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things\\nshould happen unto him,  Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem;\\nand the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto\\nthe scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver\\nhim to the Gentiles:  And they shall mock him, and shall scourge\\nhim, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he\\nshall rise again.\\n\\n And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying,\\nMaster, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall\\ndesire.\\n\\n And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?\\n They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy\\nright hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.\\n\\n But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink\\nof the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am\\nbaptized with?   And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said\\nunto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with\\nthe baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:  But\\nto sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but\\nit shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.\\n\\n And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with\\nJames and John.\\n\\n But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that\\nthey which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship\\nover them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.\\n\\n But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great\\namong you, shall be your minister:  And whosoever of you will be\\nthe chiefest, shall be servant of all.\\n\\n For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to\\nminister, and to give his life a ransom for many.\\n\\n And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his\\ndisciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of\\nTimaeus, sat by the highway side begging.\\n\\n And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry\\nout, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.\\n\\n And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried\\nthe more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.\\n\\n And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they\\ncall the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he\\ncalleth thee.\\n\\n And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.\\n\\n And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I\\nshould do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might\\nreceive my sight.\\n\\n And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee\\nwhole.\\n\\nAnd immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.\\n\\n And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany,\\nat the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples, \\nAnd saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you:\\nand as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied,\\nwhereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him.\\n\\n And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord\\nhath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither.\\n\\n And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door\\nwithout in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.\\n\\n And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye,\\nloosing the colt?   And they said unto them even as Jesus had\\ncommanded: and they let them go.\\n\\n And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on\\nhim; and he sat upon him.\\n\\n And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down\\nbranches off the trees, and strawed them in the way.\\n\\n And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying,\\nHosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord: \\nBlessed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name of\\nthe Lord: Hosanna in the highest.\\n\\n And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when\\nhe had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was\\ncome, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.\\n\\n And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was\\nhungry:  And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came,\\nif haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he\\nfound nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.\\n\\n And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee\\nhereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.\\n\\n And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and\\nbegan to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and\\noverthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that\\nsold doves;  And would not suffer that any man should carry any\\nvessel through the temple.\\n\\n And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house\\nshall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made\\nit a den of thieves.\\n\\n And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they\\nmight destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was\\nastonished at his doctrine.\\n\\n And when even was come, he went out of the city.\\n\\n And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree\\ndried up from the roots.\\n\\n And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold,\\nthe fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.\\n\\n And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.\\n\\n For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this\\nmountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall\\nnot doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he\\nsaith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.\\n\\n Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye\\npray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.\\n\\n And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against\\nany: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your\\ntrespasses.\\n\\n But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in\\nheaven forgive your trespasses.\\n\\n And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the\\ntemple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the\\nelders,  And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these\\nthings? and who gave thee this authority to do these things?  \\nAnd Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one\\nquestion, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do\\nthese things.\\n\\n The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me.\\n\\n And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From\\nheaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?   But if we\\nshall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all men counted John,\\nthat he was a prophet indeed.\\n\\n And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus\\nanswering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I\\ndo these things.\\n\\n And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man\\nplanted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for\\nthe winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went\\ninto a far country.\\n\\n And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he\\nmight receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.\\n\\n And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.\\n\\n And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast\\nstones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully\\nhandled.\\n\\n And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others;\\nbeating some, and killing some.\\n\\n Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also\\nlast unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.\\n\\n But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir;\\ncome, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.\\n\\n And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the\\nvineyard.\\n\\n What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come\\nand destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.\\n\\n And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the\\nbuilders rejected is become the head of the corner:  This was the\\nLord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?   And they sought\\nto lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had\\nspoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their\\nway.\\n\\n And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the\\nHerodians, to catch him in his words.\\n\\n And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that\\nthou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the\\nperson of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to\\ngive tribute to Caesar, or not?   Shall we give, or shall we not\\ngive? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye\\nme? bring me a penny, that I may see it.\\n\\n And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image\\nand superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar’s.\\n\\n And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things\\nthat are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s. And they\\nmarvelled at him.\\n\\n Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no\\nresurrection; and they asked him, saying,  Master, Moses wrote\\nunto us, If a man’s brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and\\nleave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up\\nseed unto his brother.\\n\\n Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and\\ndying left no seed.\\n\\n And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and\\nthe third likewise.\\n\\n And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman\\ndied also.\\n\\n In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife\\nshall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.\\n\\n And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err,\\nbecause ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?  \\nFor when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are\\ngiven in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.\\n\\n And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in\\nthe book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am\\nthe God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?  \\nHe is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore\\ndo greatly err.\\n\\n And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning\\ntogether, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him,\\nWhich is the first commandment of all?   And Jesus answered him,\\nThe first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God\\nis one Lord:  And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy\\nheart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy\\nstrength: this is the first commandment.\\n\\n And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy\\nneighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than\\nthese.\\n\\n And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the\\ntruth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:  And\\nto love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and\\nwith all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his\\nneighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and\\nsacrifices.\\n\\n And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto\\nhim, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that\\ndurst ask him any question.\\n\\n And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How\\nsay the scribes that Christ is the son of David?   For David\\nhimself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on\\nmy right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.\\n\\n David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then\\nhis son? And the common people heard him gladly.\\n\\n And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes,\\nwhich love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the\\nmarketplaces,  And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the\\nuppermost rooms at feasts:  Which devour widows’ houses, and for\\na pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.\\n\\n And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the\\npeople cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in\\nmuch.\\n\\n And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites,\\nwhich make a farthing.\\n\\n And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them,\\nVerily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than\\nall they which have cast into the treasury:  For all they did\\ncast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that\\nshe had, even all her living.\\n\\n And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto\\nhim, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!\\n And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great\\nbuildings?  there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall\\nnot be thrown down.\\n\\n And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple,\\nPeter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,  Tell us,\\nwhen shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these\\nthings shall be fulfilled?   And Jesus answering them began to\\nsay, Take heed lest any man deceive you:  For many shall come in\\nmy name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.\\n\\n And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not\\ntroubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.\\n\\n For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against\\nkingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there\\nshall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.\\n\\n But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to\\ncouncils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be\\nbrought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against\\nthem.\\n\\n And the gospel must first be published among all nations.\\n\\n But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no\\nthought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but\\nwhatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is\\nnot ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.\\n\\n Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the\\nfather the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and\\nshall cause them to be put to death.\\n\\n And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that\\nshall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.\\n\\n But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of\\nby Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that\\nreadeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the\\nmountains:  And let him that is on the housetop not go down into\\nthe house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house:\\n And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take\\nup his garment.\\n\\n But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck\\nin those days!   And pray ye that your flight be not in the\\nwinter.\\n\\n For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the\\nbeginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither\\nshall be.\\n\\n And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh\\nshould be saved: but for the elect’s sake, whom he hath chosen, he\\nhath shortened the days.\\n\\n And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or,\\nlo, he is there; believe him not:  For false Christs and false\\nprophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if\\nit were possible, even the elect.\\n\\n But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.\\n\\n But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be\\ndarkened, and the moon shall not give her light,  And the stars\\nof heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be\\nshaken.\\n\\n And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with\\ngreat power and glory.\\n\\n And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his\\nelect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the\\nuttermost part of heaven.\\n\\n Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet\\ntender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near: \\nSo ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass,\\nknow that it is nigh, even at the doors.\\n\\n Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till\\nall these things be done.\\n\\n Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass\\naway.\\n\\n But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels\\nwhich are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.\\n\\n Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.\\n\\n For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey, who left\\nhis house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his\\nwork, and commanded the porter to watch.\\n\\n Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house\\ncometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the\\nmorning:  Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.\\n\\n And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.\\n\\n After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened\\nbread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might\\ntake him by craft, and put him to death.\\n\\n But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of\\nthe people.\\n\\n And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat\\nat meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of\\nspikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on his\\nhead.\\n\\n And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and\\nsaid, Why was this waste of the ointment made?   For it might have\\nbeen sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to\\nthe poor. And they murmured against her.\\n\\n And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath\\nwrought a good work on me.\\n\\n For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye\\nmay do them good: but me ye have not always.\\n\\n She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my\\nbody to the burying.\\n\\n Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached\\nthroughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be\\nspoken of for a memorial of her.\\n\\n And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief\\npriests, to betray him unto them.\\n\\n And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him\\nmoney. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.\\n\\n And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the\\npassover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and\\nprepare that thou mayest eat the passover?   And he sendeth forth\\ntwo of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and\\nthere shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.\\n\\n And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the\\nhouse, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat\\nthe passover with my disciples?   And he will shew you a large\\nupper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.\\n\\n And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found\\nas he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.\\n\\n And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.\\n\\n And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you,\\nOne of you which eateth with me shall betray me.\\n\\n And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one,\\nIs it I? and another said, Is it I?   And he answered and said\\nunto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.\\n\\n The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to\\nthat man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man\\nif he had never been born.\\n\\n And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake\\nit, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.\\n\\n And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to\\nthem: and they all drank of it.\\n\\n And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament,\\nwhich is shed for many.\\n\\n Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the\\nvine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.\\n\\n And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of\\nOlives.\\n\\n And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of\\nme this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the\\nsheep shall be scattered.\\n\\n But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.\\n\\n But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet\\nwill not I.\\n\\n And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day,\\neven in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me\\nthrice.\\n\\n But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I\\nwill not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.\\n\\n And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he\\nsaith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.\\n\\n And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be\\nsore amazed, and to be very heavy;  And saith unto them, My soul\\nis exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.\\n\\n And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed\\nthat, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.\\n\\n And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee;\\ntake away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what\\nthou wilt.\\n\\n And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter,\\nSimon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?   Watch\\nye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready,\\nbut the flesh is weak.\\n\\n And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.\\n\\n And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their\\neyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.\\n\\n And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now,\\nand take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of\\nman is betrayed into the hands of sinners.\\n\\n Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.\\n\\n And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the\\ntwelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from\\nthe chief priests and the scribes and the elders.\\n\\n And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying,\\nWhomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away\\nsafely.\\n\\n And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and\\nsaith, Master, master; and kissed him.\\n\\n And they laid their hands on him, and took him.\\n\\n And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant\\nof the high priest, and cut off his ear.\\n\\n And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as\\nagainst a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?   I was\\ndaily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the\\nscriptures must be fulfilled.\\n\\n And they all forsook him, and fled.\\n\\n And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth\\ncast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him: \\nAnd he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.\\n\\n And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were\\nassembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.\\n\\n And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the\\nhigh priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the\\nfire.\\n\\n And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness\\nagainst Jesus to put him to death; and found none.\\n\\n For many bare false witness against him, but their witness\\nagreed not together.\\n\\n And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him,\\nsaying,  We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is\\nmade with hands, and within three days I will build another made\\nwithout hands.\\n\\n But neither so did their witness agree together.\\n\\n And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus,\\nsaying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against\\nthee?   But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the\\nhigh priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son\\nof the Blessed?   And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son\\nof man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of\\nheaven.\\n\\n Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we\\nany further witnesses?   Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think\\nye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.\\n\\n And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to\\nbuffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike\\nhim with the palms of their hands.\\n\\n And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the\\nmaids of the high priest:  And when she saw Peter warming\\nhimself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus\\nof Nazareth.\\n\\n But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what\\nthou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.\\n\\n And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood\\nby, This is one of them.\\n\\n And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by\\nsaid again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a\\nGalilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.\\n\\n But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man\\nof whom ye speak.\\n\\n And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the\\nword that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt\\ndeny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.\\n\\n And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a\\nconsultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and\\nbound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.\\n\\n And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he\\nanswering said unto them, Thou sayest it.\\n\\n And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered\\nnothing.\\n\\n And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing?\\nbehold how many things they witness against thee.\\n\\n But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.\\n\\n Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever\\nthey desired.\\n\\n And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that\\nhad made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the\\ninsurrection.\\n\\n And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he\\nhad ever done unto them.\\n\\n But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you\\nthe King of the Jews?   For he knew that the chief priests had\\ndelivered him for envy.\\n\\n But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather\\nrelease Barabbas unto them.\\n\\n And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then\\nthat I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?   And\\nthey cried out again, Crucify him.\\n\\n Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And\\nthey cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.\\n\\n And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas\\nunto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be\\ncrucified.\\n\\n And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium;\\nand they call together the whole band.\\n\\n And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns,\\nand put it about his head,  And began to salute him, Hail, King\\nof the Jews!   And they smote him on the head with a reed, and\\ndid spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.\\n\\n And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him,\\nand put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.\\n\\n And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out\\nof the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.\\n\\n And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being\\ninterpreted, The place of a skull.\\n\\n And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he\\nreceived it not.\\n\\n And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments,\\ncasting lots upon them, what every man should take.\\n\\n And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.\\n\\n And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE\\nKING OF THE JEWS.\\n\\n And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right\\nhand, and the other on his left.\\n\\n And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was\\nnumbered with the transgressors.\\n\\n And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and\\nsaying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three\\ndays,  Save thyself, and come down from the cross.\\n\\n Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves\\nwith the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.\\n\\n Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that\\nwe may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled\\nhim.\\n\\n And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the\\nwhole land until the ninth hour.\\n\\n And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,\\nEloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my\\nGod, why hast thou forsaken me?   And some of them that stood by,\\nwhen they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.\\n\\n And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a\\nreed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether\\nElias will come to take him down.\\n\\n And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.\\n\\n And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the\\nbottom.\\n\\n And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that\\nhe so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was\\nthe Son of God.\\n\\n There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary\\nMagdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and\\nSalome;  (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and\\nministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto\\nJerusalem.\\n\\n And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation,\\nthat is, the day before the sabbath,  Joseph of Arimathaea, an\\nhonourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came,\\nand went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.\\n\\n And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto\\nhim the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.\\n\\n And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to\\nJoseph.\\n\\n And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in\\nthe linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock,\\nand rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.\\n\\n And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he\\nwas laid.\\n\\n And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the\\nmother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might\\ncome and anoint him.\\n\\n And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they\\ncame unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.\\n\\n And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone\\nfrom the door of the sepulchre?   And when they looked, they saw\\nthat the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.\\n\\n And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on\\nthe right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were\\naffrighted.\\n\\n And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of\\nNazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the\\nplace where they laid him.\\n\\n But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth\\nbefore you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.\\n\\n And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they\\ntrembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for\\nthey were afraid.\\n\\n Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he\\nappeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven\\ndevils.\\n\\n And she went and told them that had been with him, as they\\nmourned and wept.\\n\\n And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been\\nseen of her, believed not.\\n\\n After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they\\nwalked, and went into the country.\\n\\n And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed\\nthey them.\\n\\n Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and\\nupbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they\\nbelieved not them which had seen him after he was risen.\\n\\n And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the\\ngospel to every creature.\\n\\n He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that\\nbelieveth not shall be damned.\\n\\n And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall\\nthey cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;  They\\nshall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall\\nnot hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall\\nrecover.\\n\\n So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up\\ninto heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.\\n\\n And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working\\nwith them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " ' Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a\\ndeclaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,\\n Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were\\neyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;  It seemed good to me\\nalso, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very\\nfirst, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus, \\nThat thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou\\nhast been instructed.\\n\\n THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain\\npriest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the\\ndaughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.\\n\\n And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the\\ncommandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.\\n\\n And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they\\nboth were now well stricken in years.\\n\\n And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest’s office\\nbefore God in the order of his course,  According to the custom of\\nthe priest’s office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the\\ntemple of the Lord.\\n\\n And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the\\ntime of incense.\\n\\n And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the\\nright side of the altar of incense.\\n\\n And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon\\nhim.\\n\\n But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer\\nis heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt\\ncall his name John.\\n\\n And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at\\nhis birth.\\n\\n For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink\\nneither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy\\nGhost, even from his mother’s womb.\\n\\n And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord\\ntheir God.\\n\\n And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to\\nturn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to\\nthe wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.\\n\\n And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for\\nI am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.\\n\\n And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand\\nin the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew\\nthee these glad tidings.\\n\\n And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the\\nday that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not\\nmy words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.\\n\\n And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he\\ntarried so long in the temple.\\n\\n And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they\\nperceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned\\nunto them, and remained speechless.\\n\\n And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his\\nministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.\\n\\n And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid\\nherself five months, saying,  Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in\\nthe days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.\\n\\n And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a\\ncity of Galilee, named Nazareth,  To a virgin espoused to a man\\nwhose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name\\nwas Mary.\\n\\n And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art\\nhighly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.\\n\\n And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in\\nher mind what manner of salutation this should be.\\n\\n And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found\\nfavour with God.\\n\\n And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a\\nson, and shalt call his name JESUS.\\n\\n He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest:\\nand the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:\\n And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his\\nkingdom there shall be no end.\\n\\n Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know\\nnot a man?   And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy\\nGhost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall\\novershadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of\\nthee shall be called the Son of God.\\n\\n And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son\\nin her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called\\nbarren.\\n\\n For with God nothing shall be impossible.\\n\\n And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me\\naccording to thy word. And the angel departed from her.\\n\\n And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with\\nhaste, into a city of Juda;  And entered into the house of\\nZacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.\\n\\n And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of\\nMary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the\\nHoly Ghost:  And she spake out with a loud voice, and said,\\nBlessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.\\n\\n And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come\\nto me?   For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded\\nin mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.\\n\\n And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a\\nperformance of those things which were told her from the Lord.\\n\\n And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,  And my spirit\\nhath rejoiced in God my Saviour.\\n\\n For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for,\\nbehold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.\\n\\n For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is\\nhis name.\\n\\n And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to\\ngeneration.\\n\\n He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud\\nin the imagination of their hearts.\\n\\n He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of\\nlow degree.\\n\\n He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath\\nsent empty away.\\n\\n He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;\\n As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.\\n\\n And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her\\nown house.\\n\\n Now Elisabeth’s full time came that she should be delivered; and\\nshe brought forth a son.\\n\\n And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed\\ngreat mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.\\n\\n And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to\\ncircumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of\\nhis father.\\n\\n And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called\\nJohn.\\n\\n And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is\\ncalled by this name.\\n\\n And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.\\n\\n And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is\\nJohn. And they marvelled all.\\n\\n And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and\\nhe spake, and praised God.\\n\\n And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these\\nsayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.\\n\\n And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts,\\nsaying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord\\nwas with him.\\n\\n And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and\\nprophesied, saying,  Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he\\nhath visited and redeemed his people,  And hath raised up an horn\\nof salvation for us in the house of his servant David;  As he\\nspake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the\\nworld began:  That we should be saved from our enemies, and from\\nthe hand of all that hate us;  To perform the mercy promised to\\nour fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;  The oath which he\\nsware to our father Abraham,  That he would grant unto us, that we\\nbeing delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without\\nfear,  In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of\\nour life.\\n\\n And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for\\nthou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;  To\\ngive knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their\\nsins,  Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring\\nfrom on high hath visited us,  To give light to them that sit in\\ndarkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of\\npeace.\\n\\n And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the\\ndeserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.\\n\\n And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree\\nfrom Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.\\n\\n (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of\\nSyria.)   And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.\\n\\n And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth,\\ninto Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem;\\n(because he was of the house and lineage of David:)  To be taxed\\nwith Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.\\n\\n And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were\\naccomplished that she should be delivered.\\n\\n And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in\\nswaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room\\nfor them in the inn.\\n\\n And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field,\\nkeeping watch over their flock by night.\\n\\n And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of\\nthe Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.\\n\\n And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you\\ngood tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.\\n\\n For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour,\\nwhich is Christ the Lord.\\n\\n And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped\\nin swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.\\n\\n And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly\\nhost praising God, and saying,  Glory to God in the highest, and\\non earth peace, good will toward men.\\n\\n And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into\\nheaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto\\nBethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord\\nhath made known unto us.\\n\\n And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the\\nbabe lying in a manger.\\n\\n And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying\\nwhich was told them concerning this child.\\n\\n And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were\\ntold them by the shepherds.\\n\\n But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.\\n\\n And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all\\nthe things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.\\n\\n And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the\\nchild, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel\\nbefore he was conceived in the womb.\\n\\n And when the days of her purification according to the law of\\nMoses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him\\nto the Lord;  (As it is written in the law of the LORD, Every male\\nthat openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)  And to\\noffer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the\\nLord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.\\n\\n And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon;\\nand the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of\\nIsrael: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.\\n\\n And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should\\nnot see death, before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.\\n\\n And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents\\nbrought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,\\n Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said, \\nLord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy\\nword:  For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,  Which thou hast\\nprepared before the face of all people;  A light to lighten the\\nGentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.\\n\\n And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were\\nspoken of him.\\n\\n And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold,\\nthis child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and\\nfor a sign which shall be spoken against;  (Yea, a sword shall\\npierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts\\nmay be revealed.\\n\\n And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of\\nthe tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an\\nhusband seven years from her virginity;  And she was a widow of\\nabout fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple,\\nbut served God with fastings and prayers night and day.\\n\\n And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the\\nLord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in\\nJerusalem.\\n\\n And when they had performed all things according to the law of\\nthe Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.\\n\\n And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with\\nwisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.\\n\\n Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the\\npassover.\\n\\n And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after\\nthe custom of the feast.\\n\\n And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child\\nJesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not\\nof it.\\n\\n But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day’s\\njourney; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance.\\n\\n And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem,\\nseeking him.\\n\\n And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the\\ntemple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and\\nasking them questions.\\n\\n And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and\\nanswers.\\n\\n And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto\\nhim, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I\\nhave sought thee sorrowing.\\n\\n And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not\\nthat I must be about my Father’s business?   And they understood\\nnot the saying which he spake unto them.\\n\\n And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject\\nunto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.\\n\\n And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God\\nand man.\\n\\n Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius\\nPilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee,\\nand his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of\\nTrachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,  Annas and\\nCaiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the\\nson of Zacharias in the wilderness.\\n\\n And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the\\nbaptism of repentance for the remission of sins;  As it is written\\nin the book of the words of Esaias the prophet, saying, The voice of\\none crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his\\npaths straight.\\n\\n Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be\\nbrought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough\\nways shall be made smooth;  And all flesh shall see the salvation\\nof God.\\n\\n Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of\\nhim, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the\\nwrath to come?   Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance,\\nand begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father:\\nfor I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up\\nchildren unto Abraham.\\n\\n And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every\\ntree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and\\ncast into the fire.\\n\\n And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?   He\\nanswereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart\\nto him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise.\\n\\n Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him,\\nMaster, what shall we do?   And he said unto them, Exact no more\\nthan that which is appointed you.\\n\\n And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall\\nwe do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse\\nany falsely; and be content with your wages.\\n\\n And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their\\nhearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not;  John\\nanswered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but\\none mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy\\nto unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire:\\n Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor,\\nand will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn\\nwith fire unquenchable.\\n\\n And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the\\npeople.\\n\\n But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his\\nbrother Philip’s wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done,\\n Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison.\\n\\n Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that\\nJesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened, \\nAnd the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him,\\nand a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in\\nthee I am well pleased.\\n\\n And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being\\n(as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli, \\nWhich was the son of Matthat, which was the son of Levi, which was the\\nson of Melchi, which was the son of Janna, which was the son of\\nJoseph,  Which was the son of Mattathias, which was the son of\\nAmos, which was the son of Naum, which was the son of Esli, which was\\nthe son of Nagge,  Which was the son of Maath, which was the son\\nof Mattathias, which was the son of Semei, which was the son of\\nJoseph, which was the son of Juda,  Which was the son of Joanna,\\nwhich was the son of Rhesa, which was the son of Zorobabel, which was\\nthe son of Salathiel, which was the son of Neri,  Which was the\\nson of Melchi, which was the son of Addi, which was the son of Cosam,\\nwhich was the son of Elmodam, which was the son of Er,  Which was\\nthe son of Jose, which was the son of Eliezer, which was the son of\\nJorim, which was the son of Matthat, which was the son of Levi, \\nWhich was the son of Simeon, which was the son of Juda, which was the\\nson of Joseph, which was the son of Jonan, which was the son of\\nEliakim,  Which was the son of Melea, which was the son of Menan,\\nwhich was the son of Mattatha, which was the son of Nathan, which was\\nthe son of David,  Which was the son of Jesse, which was the son\\nof Obed, which was the son of Booz, which was the son of Salmon, which\\nwas the son of Naasson,  Which was the son of Aminadab, which was\\nthe son of Aram, which was the son of Esrom, which was the son of\\nPhares, which was the son of Juda,  Which was the son of Jacob,\\nwhich was the son of Isaac, which was the son of Abraham, which was\\nthe son of Thara, which was the son of Nachor,  Which was the son\\nof Saruch, which was the son of Ragau, which was the son of Phalec,\\nwhich was the son of Heber, which was the son of Sala,  Which was\\nthe son of Cainan, which was the son of Arphaxad, which was the son of\\nSem, which was the son of Noe, which was the son of Lamech,  Which\\nwas the son of Mathusala, which was the son of Enoch, which was the\\nson of Jared, which was the son of Maleleel, which was the son of\\nCainan,  Which was the son of Enos, which was the son of Seth,\\nwhich was the son of Adam, which was the son of God.\\n\\n And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and\\nwas led by the Spirit into the wilderness,  Being forty days\\ntempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when\\nthey were ended, he afterward hungered.\\n\\n And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command\\nthis stone that it be made bread.\\n\\n And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not\\nlive by bread alone, but by every word of God.\\n\\n And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto\\nhim all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.\\n\\n And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and\\nthe glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I\\nwill I give it.\\n\\n If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.\\n\\n And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan:\\nfor it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only\\nshalt thou serve.\\n\\n And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the\\ntemple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself\\ndown from hence:  For it is written, He shall give his angels\\ncharge over thee, to keep thee:  And in their hands they shall\\nbear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.\\n\\n And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not\\ntempt the Lord thy God.\\n\\n And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from\\nhim for a season.\\n\\n And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and\\nthere went out a fame of him through all the region round about.\\n\\n And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.\\n\\n And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as\\nhis custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and\\nstood up for to read.\\n\\n And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias.\\nAnd when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was\\nwritten,  The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath\\nanointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal\\nthe brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and\\nrecovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are\\nbruised,  To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.\\n\\n And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and\\nsat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were\\nfastened on him.\\n\\n And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture\\nfulfilled in your ears.\\n\\n And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words\\nwhich proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph’s\\nson?   And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this\\nproverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in\\nCapernaum, do also here in thy country.\\n\\n And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his\\nown country.\\n\\n But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days\\nof Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when\\ngreat famine was throughout all the land;  But unto none of them\\nwas Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon, unto a woman that\\nwas a widow.\\n\\n And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the\\nprophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian.\\n\\n And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were\\nfilled with wrath,  And rose up, and thrust him out of the city,\\nand led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built,\\nthat they might cast him down headlong.\\n\\n But he passing through the midst of them went his way,  And\\ncame down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the\\nsabbath days.\\n\\n And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with\\npower.\\n\\n And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an\\nunclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,  Saying, Let us\\nalone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou\\ncome to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God.\\n\\n And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of\\nhim.\\n\\nAnd when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him,\\nand hurt him not.\\n\\n And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying,\\nWhat a word is this! for with authority and power he commandeth the\\nunclean spirits, and they come out.\\n\\n And the fame of him went out into every place of the country\\nround about.\\n\\n And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon’s\\nhouse.\\n\\nAnd Simon’s wife’s mother was taken with a great fever; and they\\nbesought him for her.\\n\\n And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her:\\nand immediately she arose and ministered unto them.\\n\\n Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with\\ndivers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every\\none of them, and healed them.\\n\\n And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou\\nart Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them not to\\nspeak: for they knew that he was Christ.\\n\\n And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place:\\nand the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he\\nshould not depart from them.\\n\\n And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other\\ncities also: for therefore am I sent.\\n\\n And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.\\n\\n And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear\\nthe word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,  And saw two\\nships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them,\\nand were washing their nets.\\n\\n And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon’s, and\\nprayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat\\ndown, and taught the people out of the ship.\\n\\n Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into\\nthe deep, and let down your nets for a draught.\\n\\n And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the\\nnight, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let\\ndown the net.\\n\\n And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of\\nfishes: and their net brake.\\n\\n And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other\\nship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled\\nboth the ships, so that they began to sink.\\n\\n When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying,\\nDepart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.\\n\\n For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught\\nof the fishes which they had taken:  And so was also James, and\\nJohn, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus\\nsaid unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.\\n\\n And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all,\\nand followed him.\\n\\n And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man\\nfull of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and besought him,\\nsaying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.\\n\\n And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be\\nthou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.\\n\\n And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to\\nthe priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded,\\nfor a testimony unto them.\\n\\n But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great\\nmultitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their\\ninfirmities.\\n\\n And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.\\n\\n And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that\\nthere were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were\\ncome out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the\\npower of the Lord was present to heal them.\\n\\n And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a\\npalsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before\\nhim.\\n\\n And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in\\nbecause of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him\\ndown through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus.\\n\\n And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are\\nforgiven thee.\\n\\n And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is\\nthis which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?\\n But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto\\nthem, What reason ye in your hearts?   Whether is easier, to say,\\nThy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?   But that\\nye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins,\\n(he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take\\nup thy couch, and go into thine house.\\n\\n And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon\\nhe lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.\\n\\n And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled\\nwith fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.\\n\\n And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named\\nLevi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow\\nme.\\n\\n And he left all, rose up, and followed him.\\n\\n And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a\\ngreat company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.\\n\\n But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples,\\nsaying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?   And\\nJesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a\\nphysician; but they that are sick.\\n\\n I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\\n\\n And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often,\\nand make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but\\nthine eat and drink?   And he said unto them, Can ye make the\\nchildren of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?\\n But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away\\nfrom them, and then shall they fast in those days.\\n\\n And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of\\na new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a\\nrent, and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the\\nold.\\n\\n And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine\\nwill burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.\\n\\n But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are\\npreserved.\\n\\n No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new: for\\nhe saith, The old is better.\\n\\n And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he\\nwent through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of\\ncorn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands.\\n\\n And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which\\nis not lawful to do on the sabbath days?   And Jesus answering them\\nsaid, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself\\nwas an hungred, and they which were with him;  How he went into the\\nhouse of God, and did take and eat the shewbread, and gave also to\\nthem that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the\\npriests alone?   And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord\\nalso of the sabbath.\\n\\n And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into\\nthe synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was\\nwithered.\\n\\n And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal\\non the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him.\\n\\n But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the\\nwithered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and\\nstood forth.\\n\\n Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful\\non the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to\\ndestroy it?   And looking round about upon them all, he said unto\\nthe man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was\\nrestored whole as the other.\\n\\n And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another\\nwhat they might do to Jesus.\\n\\n And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a\\nmountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.\\n\\n And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of\\nthem he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;  Simon, (whom\\nhe also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip\\nand Bartholomew,  Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus,\\nand Simon called Zelotes,  And Judas the brother of James, and\\nJudas Iscariot, which also was the traitor.\\n\\n And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the\\ncompany of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all\\nJudaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which\\ncame to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;  And they\\nthat were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.\\n\\n And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went\\nvirtue out of him, and healed them all.\\n\\n And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be\\nye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.\\n\\n Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed\\nare ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.\\n\\n Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall\\nseparate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out\\nyour name as evil, for the Son of man’s sake.\\n\\n Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your\\nreward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers\\nunto the prophets.\\n\\n But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your\\nconsolation.\\n\\n Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you\\nthat laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.\\n\\n Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did\\ntheir fathers to the false prophets.\\n\\n But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them\\nwhich hate you,  Bless them that curse you, and pray for them\\nwhich despitefully use you.\\n\\n And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the\\nother; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat\\nalso.\\n\\n Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh\\naway thy goods ask them not again.\\n\\n And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them\\nlikewise.\\n\\n For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for\\nsinners also love those that love them.\\n\\n And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have\\nye?  for sinners also do even the same.\\n\\n And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank\\nhave ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.\\n\\n But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for\\nnothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the\\nchildren of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the\\nevil.\\n\\n Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.\\n\\n Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall\\nnot be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:  Give, and it\\nshall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken\\ntogether, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with\\nthe same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you\\nagain.\\n\\n And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind?\\nshall they not both fall into the ditch?   The disciple is not\\nabove his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his\\nmaster.\\n\\n And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but\\nperceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?   Either how\\ncanst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that\\nis in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in\\nthine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine\\nown eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is\\nin thy brother’s eye.\\n\\n For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a\\ncorrupt tree bring forth good fruit.\\n\\n For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do\\nnot gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.\\n\\n A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth\\nthat which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his\\nheart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the\\nheart his mouth speaketh.\\n\\n And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I\\nsay?   Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth\\nthem, I will shew you to whom he is like:  He is like a man which\\nbuilt an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock:\\nand when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house,\\nand could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.\\n\\n But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a\\nfoundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did\\nbeat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house\\nwas great.\\n\\n Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the\\npeople, he entered into Capernaum.\\n\\n And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear unto him, was\\nsick, and ready to die.\\n\\n And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the\\nJews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.\\n\\n And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying,\\nThat he was worthy for whom he should do this:  For he loveth our\\nnation, and he hath built us a synagogue.\\n\\n Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the\\nhouse, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord,\\ntrouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter\\nunder my roof:  Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come\\nunto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.\\n\\n For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers,\\nand I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he\\ncometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.\\n\\n When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him\\nabout, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I\\nhave not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.\\n\\n And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the\\nservant whole that had been sick.\\n\\n And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city\\ncalled Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.\\n\\n Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was\\na dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a\\nwidow: and much people of the city was with her.\\n\\n And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said\\nunto her, Weep not.\\n\\n And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood\\nstill.\\n\\nAnd he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.\\n\\n And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered\\nhim to his mother.\\n\\n And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying,\\nThat a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited\\nhis people.\\n\\n And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and\\nthroughout all the region round about.\\n\\n And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.\\n\\n And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to\\nJesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?\\n When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath\\nsent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we\\nfor another?   And in that same hour he cured many of their\\ninfirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were\\nblind he gave sight.\\n\\n Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John\\nwhat things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame\\nwalk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to\\nthe poor the gospel is preached.\\n\\n And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.\\n\\n And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak\\nunto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness\\nfor to see?  A reed shaken with the wind?   But what went ye out\\nfor to see? A man clothed in soft raiment?  Behold, they which are\\ngorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings’ courts.\\n\\n But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you,\\nand much more than a prophet.\\n\\n This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger\\nbefore thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.\\n\\n For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is\\nnot a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in\\nthe kingdom of God is greater than he.\\n\\n And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified\\nGod, being baptized with the baptism of John.\\n\\n But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against\\nthemselves, being not baptized of him.\\n\\n And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this\\ngeneration? and to what are they like?   They are like unto\\nchildren sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and\\nsaying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have\\nmourned to you, and ye have not wept.\\n\\n For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine;\\nand ye say, He hath a devil.\\n\\n The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a\\ngluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!\\n But wisdom is justified of all her children.\\n\\n And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him.\\nAnd he went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to meat.\\n\\n And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she\\nknew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee’s house, brought an\\nalabaster box of ointment,  And stood at his feet behind him\\nweeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with\\nthe hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the\\nointment.\\n\\n Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake\\nwithin himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have\\nknown who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she\\nis a sinner.\\n\\n And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say\\nunto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.\\n\\n There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed\\nfive hundred pence, and the other fifty.\\n\\n And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both.\\nTell me therefore, which of them will love him most?   Simon\\nanswered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most.\\n\\nAnd he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.\\n\\n And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this\\nwoman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my\\nfeet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the\\nhairs of her head.\\n\\n Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in\\nhath not ceased to kiss my feet.\\n\\n My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath\\nanointed my feet with ointment.\\n\\n Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are\\nforgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same\\nloveth little.\\n\\n And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.\\n\\n And they that sat at meat with him began to say within\\nthemselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?   And he said to\\nthe woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.\\n\\n And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city\\nand village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of\\nGod: and the twelve were with him,  And certain women, which had\\nbeen healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene,\\nout of whom went seven devils,  And Joanna the wife of Chuza\\nHerod’s steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto\\nhim of their substance.\\n\\n And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him\\nout of every city, he spake by a parable:  A sower went out to sow\\nhis seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was\\ntrodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.\\n\\n And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it\\nwithered away, because it lacked moisture.\\n\\n And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and\\nchoked it.\\n\\n And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an\\nhundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath\\nears to hear, let him hear.\\n\\n And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?\\n And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the\\nkingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not\\nsee, and hearing they might not understand.\\n\\n Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.\\n\\n Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil,\\nand taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe\\nand be saved.\\n\\n They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the\\nword with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and\\nin time of temptation fall away.\\n\\n And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have\\nheard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of\\nthis life, and bring no fruit to perfection.\\n\\n But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good\\nheart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with\\npatience.\\n\\n No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel,\\nor putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they\\nwhich enter in may see the light.\\n\\n For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither\\nany thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.\\n\\n Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall\\nbe given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that\\nwhich he seemeth to have.\\n\\n Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come\\nat him for the press.\\n\\n And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy\\nbrethren stand without, desiring to see thee.\\n\\n And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are\\nthese which hear the word of God, and do it.\\n\\n Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship\\nwith his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the\\nother side of the lake. And they launched forth.\\n\\n But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of\\nwind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in\\njeopardy.\\n\\n And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we\\nperish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the\\nwater: and they ceased, and there was a calm.\\n\\n And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid\\nwondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he\\ncommandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.\\n\\n And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over\\nagainst Galilee.\\n\\n And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a\\ncertain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither\\nabode in any house, but in the tombs.\\n\\n When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and\\nwith a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son\\nof God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.\\n\\n (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man.\\nFor oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains\\nand in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil\\ninto the wilderness.)   And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy\\nname? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him.\\n\\n And they besought him that he would not command them to go out\\ninto the deep.\\n\\n And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the\\nmountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter\\ninto them. And he suffered them.\\n\\n Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine:\\nand the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were\\nchoked.\\n\\n When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went\\nand told it in the city and in the country.\\n\\n Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and\\nfound the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the\\nfeet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.\\n\\n They also which saw it told them by what means he that was\\npossessed of the devils was healed.\\n\\n Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round\\nabout besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great\\nfear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.\\n\\n Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him\\nthat he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying, \\nReturn to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done\\nunto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole\\ncity how great things Jesus had done unto him.\\n\\n And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people\\ngladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.\\n\\n And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of\\nthe synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus’ feet, and besought him that\\nhe would come into his house:  For he had one only daughter, about\\ntwelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people\\nthronged him.\\n\\n And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had\\nspent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,\\n Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and\\nimmediately her issue of blood stanched.\\n\\n And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they\\nthat were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press\\nthee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?   And Jesus said, Somebody\\nhath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.\\n\\n And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling,\\nand falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the\\npeople for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed\\nimmediately.\\n\\n And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith\\nhath made thee whole; go in peace.\\n\\n While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the\\nsynagogue’s house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not\\nthe Master.\\n\\n But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not:\\nbelieve only, and she shall be made whole.\\n\\n And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in,\\nsave Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the\\nmaiden.\\n\\n And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not\\ndead, but sleepeth.\\n\\n And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.\\n\\n And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called,\\nsaying, Maid, arise.\\n\\n And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he\\ncommanded to give her meat.\\n\\n And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they\\nshould tell no man what was done.\\n\\n Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power\\nand authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.\\n\\n And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the\\nsick.\\n\\n And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither\\nstaves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two\\ncoats apiece.\\n\\n And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence\\ndepart.\\n\\n And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city,\\nshake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.\\n\\n And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the\\ngospel, and healing every where.\\n\\n Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he\\nwas perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen\\nfrom the dead;  And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of\\nothers, that one of the old prophets was risen again.\\n\\n And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I\\nhear such things? And he desired to see him.\\n\\n And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they\\nhad done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert\\nplace belonging to the city called Bethsaida.\\n\\n And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he received\\nthem, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that\\nhad need of healing.\\n\\n And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and\\nsaid unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the\\ntowns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are\\nhere in a desert place.\\n\\n But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We\\nhave no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and\\nbuy meat for all this people.\\n\\n For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his\\ndisciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.\\n\\n And they did so, and made them all sit down.\\n\\n Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up\\nto heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to\\nset before the multitude.\\n\\n And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of\\nfragments that remained to them twelve baskets.\\n\\n And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were\\nwith him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?\\n They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and\\nothers say, that one of the old prophets is risen again.\\n\\n He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering\\nsaid, The Christ of God.\\n\\n And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man\\nthat thing;  Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and\\nbe rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain,\\nand be raised the third day.\\n\\n And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him\\ndeny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.\\n\\n For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever\\nwill lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.\\n\\n For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and\\nlose himself, or be cast away?   For whosoever shall be ashamed of\\nme and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he\\nshall come in his own glory, and in his Father’s, and of the holy\\nangels.\\n\\n But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which\\nshall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.\\n\\n And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he\\ntook Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.\\n\\n And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and\\nhis raiment was white and glistering.\\n\\n And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and\\nElias:  Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he\\nshould accomplish at Jerusalem.\\n\\n But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and\\nwhen they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood\\nwith him.\\n\\n And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto\\nJesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three\\ntabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not\\nknowing what he said.\\n\\n While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them:\\nand they feared as they entered into the cloud.\\n\\n And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my\\nbeloved Son: hear him.\\n\\n And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept\\nit close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they\\nhad seen.\\n\\n And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come\\ndown from the hill, much people met him.\\n\\n And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I\\nbeseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.\\n\\n And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it\\nteareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth\\nfrom him.\\n\\n And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.\\n\\n And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation,\\nhow long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.\\n\\n And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare\\nhim.\\n\\nAnd Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and\\ndelivered him again to his father.\\n\\n And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while\\nthey wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto\\nhis disciples,  Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for\\nthe Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.\\n\\n But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them,\\nthat they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.\\n\\n Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be\\ngreatest.\\n\\n And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child,\\nand set him by him,  And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive\\nthis child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me\\nreceiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the\\nsame shall be great.\\n\\n And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils\\nin thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.\\n\\n And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not\\nagainst us is for us.\\n\\n And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be\\nreceived up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,  And\\nsent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a\\nvillage of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.\\n\\n And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he\\nwould go to Jerusalem.\\n\\n And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord,\\nwilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume\\nthem, even as Elias did?   But he turned, and rebuked them, and\\nsaid, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.\\n\\n For the Son of man is not come to destroy men’s lives, but to\\nsave them. And they went to another village.\\n\\n And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man\\nsaid unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.\\n\\n And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air\\nhave nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.\\n\\n And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me\\nfirst to go and bury my father.\\n\\n Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou\\nand preach the kingdom of God.\\n\\n And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first\\ngo bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.\\n\\n And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the\\nplough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.\\n\\n After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and\\nsent them two and two before his face into every city and place,\\nwhither he himself would come.\\n\\n Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the\\nlabourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he\\nwould send forth labourers into his harvest.\\n\\n Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.\\n\\n Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by\\nthe way.\\n\\n And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this\\nhouse.\\n\\n And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it:\\nif not, it shall turn to you again.\\n\\n And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as\\nthey give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house\\nto house.\\n\\n And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such\\nthings as are set before you:  And heal the sick that are therein,\\nand say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.\\n\\n But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go\\nyour ways out into the streets of the same, and say,  Even the\\nvery dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against\\nyou: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is\\ncome nigh unto you.\\n\\n But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day\\nfor Sodom, than for that city.\\n\\n Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the\\nmighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in\\nyou, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and\\nashes.\\n\\n But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the\\njudgment, than for you.\\n\\n And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be\\nthrust down to hell.\\n\\n He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you\\ndespiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.\\n\\n And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the\\ndevils are subject unto us through thy name.\\n\\n And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from\\nheaven.\\n\\n Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and\\nscorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by\\nany means hurt you.\\n\\n Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are\\nsubject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written\\nin heaven.\\n\\n In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O\\nFather, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from\\nthe wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so,\\nFather; for so it seemed good in thy sight.\\n\\n All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth\\nwho the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son,\\nand he to whom the Son will reveal him.\\n\\n And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately,\\nBlessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see:  For I\\ntell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those\\nthings which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things\\nwhich ye hear, and have not heard them.\\n\\n And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying,\\nMaster, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?   He said unto\\nhim, What is written in the law? how readest thou?   And he\\nanswering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,\\nand with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy\\nmind; and thy neighbour as thyself.\\n\\n And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and\\nthou shalt live.\\n\\n But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is\\nmy neighbour?   And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down\\nfrom Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him\\nof his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.\\n\\n And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and\\nwhen he saw him, he passed by on the other side.\\n\\n And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked\\non him, and passed by on the other side.\\n\\n But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and\\nwhen he saw him, he had compassion on him,  And went to him, and\\nbound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own\\nbeast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.\\n\\n And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and\\ngave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and\\nwhatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.\\n\\n Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him\\nthat fell among the thieves?   And he said, He that shewed mercy\\non him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.\\n\\n Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a\\ncertain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into\\nher house.\\n\\n And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus’ feet,\\nand heard his word.\\n\\n But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and\\nsaid, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve\\nalone?  bid her therefore that she help me.\\n\\n And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art\\ncareful and troubled about many things:  But one thing is\\nneedful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken\\naway from her.\\n\\n And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place,\\nwhen he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to\\npray, as John also taught his disciples.\\n\\n And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in\\nheaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as\\nin heaven, so in earth.\\n\\n Give us day by day our daily bread.\\n\\n And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is\\nindebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from\\nevil.\\n\\n And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and\\nshall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three\\nloaves;  For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I\\nhave nothing to set before him?   And he from within shall answer\\nand say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are\\nwith me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.\\n\\n I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he\\nis his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give\\nhim as many as he needeth.\\n\\n And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye\\nshall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.\\n\\n For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh\\nfindeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.\\n\\n If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he\\ngive him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a\\nserpent?   Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a\\nscorpion?   If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts\\nunto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the\\nHoly Spirit to them that ask him?   And he was casting out a\\ndevil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone\\nout, the dumb spake; and the people wondered.\\n\\n But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub\\nthe chief of the devils.\\n\\n And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.\\n\\n But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom\\ndivided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided\\nagainst a house falleth.\\n\\n If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom\\nstand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.\\n\\n And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast\\nthem out? therefore shall they be your judges.\\n\\n But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the\\nkingdom of God is come upon you.\\n\\n When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in\\npeace:  But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and\\novercome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted,\\nand divideth his spoils.\\n\\n He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not\\nwith me scattereth.\\n\\n When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through\\ndry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return\\nunto my house whence I came out.\\n\\n And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.\\n\\n Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked\\nthan himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state\\nof that man is worse than the first.\\n\\n And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman\\nof the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the\\nwomb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.\\n\\n But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of\\nGod, and keep it.\\n\\n And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to\\nsay, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no\\nsign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.\\n\\n For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the\\nSon of man be to this generation.\\n\\n The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the\\nmen of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost\\nparts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a\\ngreater than Solomon is here.\\n\\n The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this\\ngeneration, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching\\nof Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.\\n\\n No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret\\nplace, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which\\ncome in may see the light.\\n\\n The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is\\nsingle, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is\\nevil, thy body also is full of darkness.\\n\\n Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not\\ndarkness.\\n\\n If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part\\ndark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of\\na candle doth give thee light.\\n\\n And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with\\nhim: and he went in, and sat down to meat.\\n\\n And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first\\nwashed before dinner.\\n\\n And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the\\noutside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of\\nravening and wickedness.\\n\\n Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that\\nwhich is within also?   But rather give alms of such things as ye\\nhave; and, behold, all things are clean unto you.\\n\\n But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all\\nmanner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these\\nought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.\\n\\n Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the\\nsynagogues, and greetings in the markets.\\n\\n Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as\\ngraves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware\\nof them.\\n\\n Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master,\\nthus saying thou reproachest us also.\\n\\n And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men with\\nburdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens\\nwith one of your fingers.\\n\\n Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and\\nyour fathers killed them.\\n\\n Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers:\\nfor they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.\\n\\n Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets\\nand apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute: \\nThat the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation\\nof the world, may be required of this generation;  From the blood\\nof Abel unto the blood of Zacharias which perished between the altar\\nand the temple: verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this\\ngeneration.\\n\\n Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of\\nknowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering\\nin ye hindered.\\n\\n And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the\\nPharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of\\nmany things:  Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something\\nout of his mouth, that they might accuse him.\\n\\n In the mean time, when there were gathered together an\\ninnumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon\\nanother, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of\\nthe leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.\\n\\n For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither\\nhid, that shall not be known.\\n\\n Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in\\nthe light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall\\nbe proclaimed upon the housetops.\\n\\n And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill\\nthe body, and after that have no more that they can do.\\n\\n But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after\\nhe hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear\\nhim.\\n\\n Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them\\nis forgotten before God?   But even the very hairs of your head\\nare all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many\\nsparrows.\\n\\n Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him\\nshall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:  But\\nhe that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of\\nGod.\\n\\n And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it\\nshall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy\\nGhost it shall not be forgiven.\\n\\n And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto\\nmagistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall\\nanswer, or what ye shall say:  For the Holy Ghost shall teach you\\nin the same hour what ye ought to say.\\n\\n And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my\\nbrother, that he divide the inheritance with me.\\n\\n And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over\\nyou?   And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of\\ncovetousness: for a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the\\nthings which he possesseth.\\n\\n And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a\\ncertain rich man brought forth plentifully:  And he thought\\nwithin himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where\\nto bestow my fruits?   And he said, This will I do: I will pull\\ndown my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my\\nfruits and my goods.\\n\\n And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up\\nfor many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.\\n\\n But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be\\nrequired of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast\\nprovided?   So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is\\nnot rich toward God.\\n\\n And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take\\nno thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body,\\nwhat ye shall put on.\\n\\n The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.\\n\\n Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which\\nneither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more\\nare ye better than the fowls?   And which of you with taking\\nthought can add to his stature one cubit?   If ye then be not\\nable to do that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the\\nrest?   Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they\\nspin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was\\nnot arrayed like one of these.\\n\\n If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field,\\nand to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you,\\nO ye of little faith?   And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or\\nwhat ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind.\\n\\n For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and\\nyour Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.\\n\\n But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things\\nshall be added unto you.\\n\\n Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to\\ngive you the kingdom.\\n\\n Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which\\nwax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no\\nthief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.\\n\\n For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\\n\\n Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning; \\nAnd ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will\\nreturn from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may\\nopen unto him immediately.\\n\\n Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall\\nfind watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and\\nmake them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.\\n\\n And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third\\nwatch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.\\n\\n And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what\\nhour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have\\nsuffered his house to be broken through.\\n\\n Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour\\nwhen ye think not.\\n\\n Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto\\nus, or even to all?   And the Lord said, Who then is that\\nfaithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his\\nhousehold, to give them their portion of meat in due season?  \\nBlessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so\\ndoing.\\n\\n Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all\\nthat he hath.\\n\\n But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his\\ncoming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to\\neat and drink, and to be drunken;  The lord of that servant will\\ncome in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is\\nnot aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his\\nportion with the unbelievers.\\n\\n And that servant, which knew his lord’s will, and prepared not\\nhimself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many\\nstripes.\\n\\n But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes,\\nshall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given,\\nof him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of\\nhim they will ask the more.\\n\\n I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be\\nalready kindled?   But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and\\nhow am I straitened till it be accomplished!   Suppose ye that I\\nam come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division:\\n For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided,\\nthree against two, and two against three.\\n\\n The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against\\nthe father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against\\nthe mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the\\ndaughter in law against her mother in law.\\n\\n And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out of\\nthe west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is.\\n\\n And when ye see the south wind blow, ye say, There will be heat;\\nand it cometh to pass.\\n\\n Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the\\nearth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?   Yea, and\\nwhy even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?   When thou\\ngoest with thine adversary to the magistrate, as thou art in the way,\\ngive diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he hale\\nthee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the\\nofficer cast thee into prison.\\n\\n I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid\\nthe very last mite.\\n\\n There were present at that season some that told him of the\\nGalilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.\\n\\n And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these\\nGalilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they\\nsuffered such things?   I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye\\nshall all likewise perish.\\n\\n Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew\\nthem, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in\\nJerusalem?   I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all\\nlikewise perish.\\n\\n He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted\\nin his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.\\n\\n Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these\\nthree years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut\\nit down; why cumbereth it the ground?   And he answering said unto\\nhim, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and\\ndung it:  And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that\\nthou shalt cut it down.\\n\\n And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.\\n\\n And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity\\neighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up\\nherself.\\n\\n And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her,\\nWoman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.\\n\\n And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made\\nstraight, and glorified God.\\n\\n And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation,\\nbecause that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the\\npeople, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them\\ntherefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.\\n\\n The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not\\neach one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall,\\nand lead him away to watering?   And ought not this woman, being\\na daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen\\nyears, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?   And when he\\nhad said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the\\npeople rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.\\n\\n Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and\\nwhereunto shall I resemble it?   It is like a grain of mustard\\nseed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and\\nwaxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of\\nit.\\n\\n And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?\\n It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures\\nof meal, till the whole was leavened.\\n\\n And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and\\njourneying toward Jerusalem.\\n\\n Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And\\nhe said unto them,  Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for\\nmany, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.\\n\\n When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to\\nthe door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door,\\nsaying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto\\nyou, I know you not whence ye are:  Then shall ye begin to say,\\nWe have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our\\nstreets.\\n\\n But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are;\\ndepart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.\\n\\n There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see\\nAbraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of\\nGod, and you yourselves thrust out.\\n\\n And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from\\nthe north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of\\nGod.\\n\\n And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are\\nfirst which shall be last.\\n\\n The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto\\nhim, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee.\\n\\n And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast\\nout devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I\\nshall be perfected.\\n\\n Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day\\nfollowing: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.\\n\\n O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest\\nthem that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy\\nchildren together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and\\nye would not!   Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and\\nverily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until the time come when\\nye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.\\n\\n And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the\\nchief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched\\nhim.\\n\\n And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the\\ndropsy.\\n\\n And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying,\\nIs it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?   And they held their\\npeace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go;  And\\nanswered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen\\ninto a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?\\n And they could not answer him again to these things.\\n\\n And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he\\nmarked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them.\\n\\n When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the\\nhighest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him;\\n And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man\\nplace; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room.\\n\\n But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room;\\nthat when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go\\nup higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that\\nsit at meat with thee.\\n\\n For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that\\nhumbleth himself shall be exalted.\\n\\n Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a\\ndinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither\\nthy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again,\\nand a recompence be made thee.\\n\\n But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the\\nlame, the blind:  And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot\\nrecompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of\\nthe just.\\n\\n And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these\\nthings, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the\\nkingdom of God.\\n\\n Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and\\nbade many:  And sent his servant at supper time to say to them\\nthat were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready.\\n\\n And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first\\nsaid unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go\\nand see it: I pray thee have me excused.\\n\\n And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to\\nprove them: I pray thee have me excused.\\n\\n And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot\\ncome.\\n\\n So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the\\nmaster of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly\\ninto the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor,\\nand the maimed, and the halt, and the blind.\\n\\n And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded,\\nand yet there is room.\\n\\n And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and\\nhedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.\\n\\n For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden\\nshall taste of my supper.\\n\\n And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and\\nsaid unto them,  If any man come to me, and hate not his father,\\nand mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea,\\nand his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.\\n\\n And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot\\nbe my disciple.\\n\\n For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down\\nfirst, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?\\n Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able\\nto finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,  Saying, This\\nman began to build, and was not able to finish.\\n\\n Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth\\nnot down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to\\nmeet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?   Or else,\\nwhile the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and\\ndesireth conditions of peace.\\n\\n So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that\\nhe hath, he cannot be my disciple.\\n\\n Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith\\nshall it be seasoned?   It is neither fit for the land, nor yet\\nfor the dunghill; but men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let\\nhim hear.\\n\\n Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear\\nhim.\\n\\n And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man\\nreceiveth sinners, and eateth with them.\\n\\n And he spake this parable unto them, saying,  What man of\\nyou, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave\\nthe ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is\\nlost, until he find it?   And when he hath found it, he layeth it\\non his shoulders, rejoicing.\\n\\n And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and\\nneighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my\\nsheep which was lost.\\n\\n I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one\\nsinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons,\\nwhich need no repentance.\\n\\n Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one\\npiece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek\\ndiligently till she find it?   And when she hath found it, she\\ncalleth her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with\\nme; for I have found the piece which I had lost.\\n\\n Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the\\nangels of God over one sinner that repenteth.\\n\\n And he said, A certain man had two sons:  And the younger\\nof them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that\\nfalleth to me. And he divided unto them his living.\\n\\n And not many days after the younger son gathered all together,\\nand took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his\\nsubstance with riotous living.\\n\\n And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that\\nland; and he began to be in want.\\n\\n And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and\\nhe sent him into his fields to feed swine.\\n\\n And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the\\nswine did eat: and no man gave unto him.\\n\\n And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of\\nmy father’s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!\\n I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father,\\nI have sinned against heaven, and before thee,  And am no more\\nworthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.\\n\\n And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a\\ngreat way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and\\nfell on his neck, and kissed him.\\n\\n And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven,\\nand in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.\\n\\n But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe,\\nand put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:\\n And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat,\\nand be merry:  For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he\\nwas lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.\\n\\n Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh\\nto the house, he heard musick and dancing.\\n\\n And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things\\nmeant.\\n\\n And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath\\nkilled the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.\\n\\n And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father\\nout, and intreated him.\\n\\n And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I\\nserve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and\\nyet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my\\nfriends:  But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath\\ndevoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted\\ncalf.\\n\\n And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I\\nhave is thine.\\n\\n It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy\\nbrother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.\\n\\n And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich\\nman, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he\\nhad wasted his goods.\\n\\n And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this\\nof thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no\\nlonger steward.\\n\\n Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my\\nlord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am\\nashamed.\\n\\n I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the\\nstewardship, they may receive me into their houses.\\n\\n So he called every one of his lord’s debtors unto him, and said\\nunto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?   And he said,\\nAn hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and\\nsit down quickly, and write fifty.\\n\\n Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An\\nhundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and\\nwrite fourscore.\\n\\n And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done\\nwisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser\\nthan the children of light.\\n\\n And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of\\nunrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into\\neverlasting habitations.\\n\\n He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in\\nmuch: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.\\n\\n If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous\\nmammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?   And if\\nye have not been faithful in that which is another man’s, who shall\\ngive you that which is your own?   No servant can serve two\\nmasters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else\\nhe will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God\\nand mammon.\\n\\n And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these\\nthings: and they derided him.\\n\\n And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves\\nbefore men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly\\nesteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.\\n\\n The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the\\nkingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.\\n\\n And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle\\nof the law to fail.\\n\\n Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another,\\ncommitteth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from\\nher husband committeth adultery.\\n\\n There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and\\nfine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:  And there was a\\ncertain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of\\nsores,  And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from\\nthe rich man’s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.\\n\\n And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by\\nthe angels into Abraham’s bosom: the rich man also died, and was\\nburied;  And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and\\nseeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.\\n\\n And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and\\nsend Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool\\nmy tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.\\n\\n But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime\\nreceivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now\\nhe is comforted, and thou art tormented.\\n\\n And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf\\nfixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither\\ncan they pass to us, that would come from thence.\\n\\n Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest\\nsend him to my father’s house:  For I have five brethren; that he\\nmay testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.\\n\\n Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let\\nthem hear them.\\n\\n And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from\\nthe dead, they will repent.\\n\\n And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets,\\nneither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.\\n\\n Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that\\noffences will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come!   It\\nwere better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and\\nhe cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little\\nones.\\n\\n Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee,\\nrebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.\\n\\n And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven\\ntimes in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt\\nforgive him.\\n\\n And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.\\n\\n And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye\\nmight say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and\\nbe thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.\\n\\n But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle,\\nwill say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and\\nsit down to meat?   And will not rather say unto him, Make ready\\nwherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten\\nand drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?   Doth he\\nthank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him?\\nI trow not.\\n\\n So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which\\nare commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done\\nthat which was our duty to do.\\n\\n And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed\\nthrough the midst of Samaria and Galilee.\\n\\n And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men\\nthat were lepers, which stood afar off:  And they lifted up their\\nvoices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.\\n\\n And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto\\nthe priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were\\ncleansed.\\n\\n And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back,\\nand with a loud voice glorified God,  And fell down on his face\\nat his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.\\n\\n And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where\\nare the nine?   There are not found that returned to give glory\\nto God, save this stranger.\\n\\n And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made\\nthee whole.\\n\\n And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of\\nGod should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh\\nnot with observation:  Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo\\nthere! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.\\n\\n And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye\\nshall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall\\nnot see it.\\n\\n And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after\\nthem, nor follow them.\\n\\n For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part under\\nheaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the\\nSon of man be in his day.\\n\\n But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this\\ngeneration.\\n\\n And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the\\ndays of the Son of man.\\n\\n They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in\\nmarriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood\\ncame, and destroyed them all.\\n\\n Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they\\ndrank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;  But\\nthe same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone\\nfrom heaven, and destroyed them all.\\n\\n Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is\\nrevealed.\\n\\n In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff\\nin the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in\\nthe field, let him likewise not return back.\\n\\n Remember Lot’s wife.\\n\\n Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and\\nwhosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.\\n\\n I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the\\none shall be taken, and the other shall be left.\\n\\n Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken,\\nand the other left.\\n\\n Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the\\nother left.\\n\\n And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said\\nunto them, Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be\\ngathered together.\\n\\n And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought\\nalways to pray, and not to faint;  Saying, There was in a city a\\njudge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:  And there was\\na widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine\\nadversary.\\n\\n And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within\\nhimself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;  Yet because this\\nwidow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming\\nshe weary me.\\n\\n And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.\\n\\n And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night\\nunto him, though he bear long with them?   I tell you that he will\\navenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall\\nhe find faith on the earth?   And he spake this parable unto\\ncertain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and\\ndespised others:  Two men went up into the temple to pray; the\\none a Pharisee, and the other a publican.\\n\\n The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank\\nthee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust,\\nadulterers, or even as this publican.\\n\\n I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.\\n\\n And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much\\nas his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be\\nmerciful to me a sinner.\\n\\n I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather\\nthan the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased;\\nand he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.\\n\\n And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch\\nthem: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.\\n\\n But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children\\nto come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of\\nGod.\\n\\n Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom\\nof God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.\\n\\n And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I\\ndo to inherit eternal life?   And Jesus said unto him, Why\\ncallest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God.\\n\\n Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not\\nkill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and\\nthy mother.\\n\\n And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.\\n\\n Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest\\nthou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor,\\nand thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.\\n\\n And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very\\nrich.\\n\\n And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How\\nhardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!\\n For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than\\nfor a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.\\n\\n And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?   And\\nhe said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with\\nGod.\\n\\n Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.\\n\\n And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man\\nthat hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children,\\nfor the kingdom of God’s sake,  Who shall not receive manifold\\nmore in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.\\n\\n Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we\\ngo up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets\\nconcerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.\\n\\n For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be\\nmocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:  And they shall\\nscourge him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise\\nagain.\\n\\n And they understood none of these things: and this saying was\\nhid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.\\n\\n And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a\\ncertain blind man sat by the way side begging:  And hearing the\\nmultitude pass by, he asked what it meant.\\n\\n And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.\\n\\n And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on\\nme.\\n\\n And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his\\npeace: but he cried so much the more, Thou son of David, have mercy on\\nme.\\n\\n And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and\\nwhen he was come near, he asked him,  Saying, What wilt thou that\\nI shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.\\n\\n And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved\\nthee.\\n\\n And immediately he received his sight, and followed him,\\nglorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto\\nGod.\\n\\n And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.\\n\\n And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief\\namong the publicans, and he was rich.\\n\\n And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the\\npress, because he was little of stature.\\n\\n And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see\\nhim: for he was to pass that way.\\n\\n And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and\\nsaid unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must\\nabide at thy house.\\n\\n And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.\\n\\n And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone\\nto be guest with a man that is a sinner.\\n\\n And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord: Behold, Lord, the\\nhalf of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing\\nfrom any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.\\n\\n And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this\\nhouse, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.\\n\\n For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was\\nlost.\\n\\n And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable,\\nbecause he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the\\nkingdom of God should immediately appear.\\n\\n He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to\\nreceive for himself a kingdom, and to return.\\n\\n And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds,\\nand said unto them, Occupy till I come.\\n\\n But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him,\\nsaying, We will not have this man to reign over us.\\n\\n And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received\\nthe kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him,\\nto whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man\\nhad gained by trading.\\n\\n Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten\\npounds.\\n\\n And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast\\nbeen faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities.\\n\\n And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five\\npounds.\\n\\n And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.\\n\\n And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which\\nI have kept laid up in a napkin:  For I feared thee, because thou\\nart an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and\\nreapest that thou didst not sow.\\n\\n And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee,\\nthou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up\\nthat I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:  Wherefore\\nthen gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might\\nhave required mine own with usury?   And he said unto them that\\nstood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten\\npounds.\\n\\n (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)   For I\\nsay unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from\\nhim that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him.\\n\\n But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over\\nthem, bring hither, and slay them before me.\\n\\n And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to\\nJerusalem.\\n\\n And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and\\nBethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his\\ndisciples,  Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in\\nthe which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet\\nnever man sat: loose him, and bring him hither.\\n\\n And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say\\nunto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.\\n\\n And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had\\nsaid unto them.\\n\\n And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto\\nthem, Why loose ye the colt?   And they said, The Lord hath need\\nof him.\\n\\n And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon\\nthe colt, and they set Jesus thereon.\\n\\n And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.\\n\\n And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount\\nof Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and\\npraise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had\\nseen;  Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the\\nLord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.\\n\\n And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto\\nhim, Master, rebuke thy disciples.\\n\\n And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these\\nshould hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.\\n\\n And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,\\n Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy\\nday, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from\\nthine eyes.\\n\\n For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast\\na trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every\\nside,  And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children\\nwithin thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another;\\nbecause thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.\\n\\n And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that\\nsold therein, and them that bought;  Saying unto them, It is\\nwritten, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of\\nthieves.\\n\\n And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the\\nscribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,  And\\ncould not find what they might do: for all the people were very\\nattentive to hear him.\\n\\n And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the\\npeople in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and\\nthe scribes came upon him with the elders,  And spake unto him,\\nsaying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is\\nhe that gave thee this authority?   And he answered and said unto\\nthem, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:  The baptism\\nof John, was it from heaven, or of men?   And they reasoned with\\nthemselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why\\nthen believed ye him not?   But and if we say, Of men; all the\\npeople will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet.\\n\\n And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.\\n\\n And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I\\ndo these things.\\n\\n Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man\\nplanted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a\\nfar country for a long time.\\n\\n And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they\\nshould give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat\\nhim, and sent him away empty.\\n\\n And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and\\nentreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.\\n\\n And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast\\nhim out.\\n\\n Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send\\nmy beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him.\\n\\n But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves,\\nsaying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance\\nmay be ours.\\n\\n So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What\\ntherefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?   He shall\\ncome and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to\\nothers. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.\\n\\n And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written,\\nThe stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of\\nthe corner?   Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be\\nbroken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.\\n\\n And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to\\nlay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that\\nhe had spoken this parable against them.\\n\\n And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign\\nthemselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so\\nthey might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.\\n\\n And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and\\nteachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but\\nteachest the way of God truly:  Is it lawful for us to give\\ntribute unto Caesar, or no?   But he perceived their craftiness,\\nand said unto them, Why tempt ye me?   Shew me a penny. Whose\\nimage and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar’s.\\n\\n And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things\\nwhich be Caesar’s, and unto God the things which be God’s.\\n\\n And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and\\nthey marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.\\n\\n Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there\\nis any resurrection; and they asked him,  Saying, Master, Moses\\nwrote unto us, If any man’s brother die, having a wife, and he die\\nwithout children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up\\nseed unto his brother.\\n\\n There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife,\\nand died without children.\\n\\n And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.\\n\\n And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and\\nthey left no children, and died.\\n\\n Last of all the woman died also.\\n\\n Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for\\nseven had her to wife.\\n\\n And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world\\nmarry, and are given in marriage:  But they which shall be\\naccounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the\\ndead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:  Neither can they\\ndie any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children\\nof God, being the children of the resurrection.\\n\\n Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush,\\nwhen he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and\\nthe God of Jacob.\\n\\n For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live\\nunto him.\\n\\n Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast\\nwell said.\\n\\n And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.\\n\\n And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David’s son?\\n And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said\\nunto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,  Till I make thine\\nenemies thy footstool.\\n\\n David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?  \\nThen in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,\\n Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and\\nlove greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the\\nsynagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;  Which devour widows’\\nhouses, and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receive\\ngreater damnation.\\n\\n And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into\\nthe treasury.\\n\\n And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two\\nmites.\\n\\n And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath\\ncast in more than they all:  For all these have of their abundance\\ncast in unto the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in\\nall the living that she had.\\n\\n And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly\\nstones and gifts, he said,  As for these things which ye behold,\\nthe days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone\\nupon another, that shall not be thrown down.\\n\\n And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things\\nbe?  and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass?\\n And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall\\ncome in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near: go ye\\nnot therefore after them.\\n\\n But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified:\\nfor these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and\\nby.\\n\\n Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and\\nkingdom against kingdom:  And great earthquakes shall be in\\ndivers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and\\ngreat signs shall there be from heaven.\\n\\n But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and\\npersecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons,\\nbeing brought before kings and rulers for my name’s sake.\\n\\n And it shall turn to you for a testimony.\\n\\n Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what\\nye shall answer:  For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which\\nall your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.\\n\\n And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and\\nkinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to\\ndeath.\\n\\n And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake.\\n\\n But there shall not an hair of your head perish.\\n\\n In your patience possess ye your souls.\\n\\n And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know\\nthat the desolation thereof is nigh.\\n\\n Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let\\nthem which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that\\nare in the countries enter thereinto.\\n\\n For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are\\nwritten may be fulfilled.\\n\\n But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give\\nsuck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land,\\nand wrath upon this people.\\n\\n And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led\\naway captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of\\nthe Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.\\n\\n And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the\\nstars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the\\nsea and the waves roaring;  Men’s hearts failing them for fear,\\nand for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for\\nthe powers of heaven shall be shaken.\\n\\n And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with\\npower and great glory.\\n\\n And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and\\nlift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.\\n\\n And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the\\ntrees;  When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own\\nselves that summer is now nigh at hand.\\n\\n So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye\\nthat the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.\\n\\n Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till\\nall be fulfilled.\\n\\n Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass\\naway.\\n\\n And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be\\novercharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life,\\nand so that day come upon you unawares.\\n\\n For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face\\nof the whole earth.\\n\\n Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted\\nworthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to\\nstand before the Son of man.\\n\\n And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night\\nhe went out, and abode in the mount that is called the mount of\\nOlives.\\n\\n And all the people came early in the morning to him in the\\ntemple, for to hear him.\\n\\n Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the\\nPassover.\\n\\n And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him;\\nfor they feared the people.\\n\\n Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the\\nnumber of the twelve.\\n\\n And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and\\ncaptains, how he might betray him unto them.\\n\\n And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.\\n\\n And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them\\nin the absence of the multitude.\\n\\n Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be\\nkilled.\\n\\n And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the\\npassover, that we may eat.\\n\\n And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?  \\nAnd he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city,\\nthere shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him\\ninto the house where he entereth in.\\n\\n And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith\\nunto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover\\nwith my disciples?   And he shall shew you a large upper room\\nfurnished: there make ready.\\n\\n And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made\\nready the passover.\\n\\n And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles\\nwith him.\\n\\n And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this\\npassover with you before I suffer:  For I say unto you, I will\\nnot any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.\\n\\n And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and\\ndivide it among yourselves:  For I say unto you, I will not drink\\nof the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.\\n\\n And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto\\nthem, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in\\nremembrance of me.\\n\\n Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new\\ntestament in my blood, which is shed for you.\\n\\n But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the\\ntable.\\n\\n And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe\\nunto that man by whom he is betrayed!   And they began to enquire\\namong themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.\\n\\n And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be\\naccounted the greatest.\\n\\n And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise\\nlordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are\\ncalled benefactors.\\n\\n But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let\\nhim be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.\\n\\n For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that\\nserveth?  is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he\\nthat serveth.\\n\\n Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.\\n\\n And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed\\nunto me;  That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom,\\nand sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.\\n\\n And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to\\nhave you, that he may sift you as wheat:  But I have prayed for\\nthee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen\\nthy brethren.\\n\\n And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both\\ninto prison, and to death.\\n\\n And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this\\nday, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.\\n\\n And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip,\\nand shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.\\n\\n Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him\\ntake it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him\\nsell his garment, and buy one.\\n\\n For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be\\naccomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for\\nthe things concerning me have an end.\\n\\n And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said\\nunto them, It is enough.\\n\\n And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of\\nOlives; and his disciples also followed him.\\n\\n And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye\\nenter not into temptation.\\n\\n And he was withdrawn from them about a stone’s cast, and kneeled\\ndown, and prayed,  Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove\\nthis cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.\\n\\n And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening\\nhim.\\n\\n And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat\\nwas as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.\\n\\n And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples,\\nhe found them sleeping for sorrow,  And said unto them, Why sleep\\nye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.\\n\\n And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was\\ncalled Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto\\nJesus to kiss him.\\n\\n But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man\\nwith a kiss?   When they which were about him saw what would\\nfollow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?\\n And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut\\noff his right ear.\\n\\n And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched\\nhis ear, and healed him.\\n\\n Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the\\ntemple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as\\nagainst a thief, with swords and staves?   When I was daily with\\nyou in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is\\nyour hour, and the power of darkness.\\n\\n Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high\\npriest’s house. And Peter followed afar off.\\n\\n And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and\\nwere set down together, Peter sat down among them.\\n\\n But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and\\nearnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.\\n\\n And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.\\n\\n And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art\\nalso of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.\\n\\n And about the space of one hour after another confidently\\naffirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is\\na Galilaean.\\n\\n And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And\\nimmediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.\\n\\n And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered\\nthe word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow,\\nthou shalt deny me thrice.\\n\\n And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.\\n\\n And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.\\n\\n And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face,\\nand asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?   And\\nmany other things blasphemously spake they against him.\\n\\n And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the\\nchief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their\\ncouncil, saying,  Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto\\nthem, If I tell you, ye will not believe:  And if I also ask you,\\nye will not answer me, nor let me go.\\n\\n Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the\\npower of God.\\n\\n Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said\\nunto them, Ye say that I am.\\n\\n And they said, What need we any further witness? for we\\nourselves have heard of his own mouth.\\n\\n And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.\\n\\n And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow\\nperverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar,\\nsaying that he himself is Christ a King.\\n\\n And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And\\nhe answered him and said, Thou sayest it.\\n\\n Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find\\nno fault in this man.\\n\\n And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people,\\nteaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.\\n\\n When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a\\nGalilaean.\\n\\n And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod’s\\njurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem\\nat that time.\\n\\n And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was\\ndesirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things\\nof him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.\\n\\n Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him\\nnothing.\\n\\n And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused\\nhim.\\n\\n And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him,\\nand arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.\\n\\n And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together:\\nfor before they were at enmity between themselves.\\n\\n And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and\\nthe rulers and the people,  Said unto them, Ye have brought this\\nman unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having\\nexamined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching\\nthose things whereof ye accuse him:  No, nor yet Herod: for I\\nsent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.\\n\\n I will therefore chastise him, and release him.\\n\\n (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)\\n And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and\\nrelease unto us Barabbas:  (Who for a certain sedition made in\\nthe city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)   Pilate\\ntherefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.\\n\\n But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.\\n\\n And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he\\ndone? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise\\nhim, and let him go.\\n\\n And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might\\nbe crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests\\nprevailed.\\n\\n And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.\\n\\n And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was\\ncast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to\\ntheir will.\\n\\n And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a\\nCyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross,\\nthat he might bear it after Jesus.\\n\\n And there followed him a great company of people, and of women,\\nwhich also bewailed and lamented him.\\n\\n But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep\\nnot for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.\\n\\n For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say,\\nBlessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps\\nwhich never gave suck.\\n\\n Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and\\nto the hills, Cover us.\\n\\n For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done\\nin the dry?   And there were also two other, malefactors, led\\nwith him to be put to death.\\n\\n And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary,\\nthere they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand,\\nand the other on the left.\\n\\n Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what\\nthey do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.\\n\\n And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them\\nderided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be\\nChrist, the chosen of God.\\n\\n And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering\\nhim vinegar,  And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save\\nthyself.\\n\\n And a superscription also was written over him in letters of\\nGreek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.\\n\\n And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him,\\nsaying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.\\n\\n But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear\\nGod, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?   And we indeed\\njustly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath\\ndone nothing amiss.\\n\\n And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into\\nthy kingdom.\\n\\n And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt\\nthou be with me in paradise.\\n\\n And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over\\nall the earth until the ninth hour.\\n\\n And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in\\nthe midst.\\n\\n And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father,\\ninto thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up\\nthe ghost.\\n\\n Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God,\\nsaying, Certainly this was a righteous man.\\n\\n And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding\\nthe things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.\\n\\n And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from\\nGalilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.\\n\\n And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he\\nwas a good man, and a just:  (The same had not consented to the\\ncounsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews:\\nwho also himself waited for the kingdom of God.\\n\\n This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.\\n\\n And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a\\nsepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.\\n\\n And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.\\n\\n And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed\\nafter, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.\\n\\n And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested\\nthe sabbath day according to the commandment.\\n\\n Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning,\\nthey came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had\\nprepared, and certain others with them.\\n\\n And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.\\n\\n And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.\\n\\n And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout,\\nbehold, two men stood by them in shining garments:  And as they\\nwere afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto\\nthem, Why seek ye the living among the dead?   He is not here, but\\nis risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,\\n Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful\\nmen, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.\\n\\n And they remembered his words,  And returned from the\\nsepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the\\nrest.\\n\\n It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James,\\nand other women that were with them, which told these things unto the\\napostles.\\n\\n And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed\\nthem not.\\n\\n Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down,\\nhe beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed,\\nwondering in himself at that which was come to pass.\\n\\n And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called\\nEmmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.\\n\\n And they talked together of all these things which had happened.\\n\\n And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and\\nreasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.\\n\\n But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.\\n\\n And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these\\nthat ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?   And the\\none of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou\\nonly a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are\\ncome to pass there in these days?   And he said unto them, What\\nthings? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which\\nwas a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:\\n And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be\\ncondemned to death, and have crucified him.\\n\\n But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed\\nIsrael: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these\\nthings were done.\\n\\n Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished,\\nwhich were early at the sepulchre;  And when they found not his\\nbody, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels,\\nwhich said that he was alive.\\n\\n And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre,\\nand found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.\\n\\n Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe\\nall that the prophets have spoken:  Ought not Christ to have\\nsuffered these things, and to enter into his glory?   And\\nbeginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all\\nthe scriptures the things concerning himself.\\n\\n And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he\\nmade as though he would have gone further.\\n\\n But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is\\ntoward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with\\nthem.\\n\\n And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread,\\nand blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.\\n\\n And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished\\nout of their sight.\\n\\n And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us,\\nwhile he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the\\nscriptures?   And they rose up the same hour, and returned to\\nJerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were\\nwith them,  Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared\\nto Simon.\\n\\n And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was\\nknown of them in breaking of bread.\\n\\n And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of\\nthem, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.\\n\\n But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they\\nhad seen a spirit.\\n\\n And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts\\narise in your hearts?   Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I\\nmyself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as\\nye see me have.\\n\\n And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his\\nfeet.\\n\\n And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said\\nunto them, Have ye here any meat?   And they gave him a piece of\\na broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.\\n\\n And he took it, and did eat before them.\\n\\n And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto\\nyou, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled,\\nwhich were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in\\nthe psalms, concerning me.\\n\\n Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand\\nthe scriptures,  And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus\\nit behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:\\n And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in\\nhis name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.\\n\\n And ye are witnesses of these things.\\n\\n And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry\\nye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on\\nhigh.\\n\\n And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his\\nhands, and blessed them.\\n\\n And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from\\nthem, and carried up into heaven.\\n\\n And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great\\njoy:  And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing\\nGod. Amen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " ' In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the\\nWord was God.\\n\\n The same was in the beginning with God.\\n\\n All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing\\nmade that was made.\\n\\n In him was life; and the life was the light of men.\\n\\n And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended\\nit not.\\n\\n There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.\\n\\n The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that\\nall men through him might believe.\\n\\n He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.\\n\\n That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into\\nthe world.\\n\\n He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world\\nknew him not.\\n\\n He came unto his own, and his own received him not.\\n\\n But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the\\nsons of God, even to them that believe on his name:  Which were\\nborn, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of\\nman, but of God.\\n\\n And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld\\nhis glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of\\ngrace and truth.\\n\\n John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom\\nI spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was\\nbefore me.\\n\\n And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.\\n\\n For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus\\nChrist.\\n\\n No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is\\nin the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.\\n\\n And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and\\nLevites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?   And he\\nconfessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.\\n\\n And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am\\nnot. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.\\n\\n Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer\\nto them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?   He said, I am\\nthe voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of\\nthe Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.\\n\\n And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.\\n\\n And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then,\\nif thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?  \\nJohn answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth\\none among you, whom ye know not;  He it is, who coming after me is\\npreferred before me, whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose.\\n\\n These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was\\nbaptizing.\\n\\n The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold\\nthe Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\\n\\n This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is\\npreferred before me: for he was before me.\\n\\n And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to\\nIsrael, therefore am I come baptizing with water.\\n\\n And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from\\nheaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.\\n\\n And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water,\\nthe same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending,\\nand remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy\\nGhost.\\n\\n And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.\\n\\n Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;\\n And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of\\nGod!   And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed\\nJesus.\\n\\n Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them,\\nWhat seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being\\ninterpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?   He saith unto them,\\nCome and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him\\nthat day: for it was about the tenth hour.\\n\\n One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was\\nAndrew, Simon Peter’s brother.\\n\\n He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We\\nhave found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.\\n\\n And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said,\\nThou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is\\nby interpretation, A stone.\\n\\n The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth\\nPhilip, and saith unto him, Follow me.\\n\\n Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.\\n\\n Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him,\\nof whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of\\nNazareth, the son of Joseph.\\n\\n And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of\\nNazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.\\n\\n Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an\\nIsraelite indeed, in whom is no guile!   Nathanael saith unto him,\\nWhence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that\\nPhilip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.\\n\\n Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of\\nGod; thou art the King of Israel.\\n\\n Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw\\nthee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things\\nthan these.\\n\\n And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter\\nye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and\\ndescending upon the Son of man.\\n\\n And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the\\nmother of Jesus was there:  And both Jesus was called, and his\\ndisciples, to the marriage.\\n\\n And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him,\\nThey have no wine.\\n\\n Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine\\nhour is not yet come.\\n\\n His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you,\\ndo it.\\n\\n And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner\\nof the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.\\n\\n Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they\\nfilled them up to the brim.\\n\\n And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor\\nof the feast. And they bare it.\\n\\n When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made\\nwine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the\\nwater knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,  And\\nsaith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine;\\nand when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast\\nkept the good wine until now.\\n\\n This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and\\nmanifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.\\n\\n After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his\\nbrethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.\\n\\n And the Jews’ passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to\\nJerusalem.\\n\\n And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves,\\nand the changers of money sitting:  And when he had made a scourge\\nof small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep,\\nand the oxen; and poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew the\\ntables;  And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things\\nhence; make not my Father’s house an house of merchandise.\\n\\n And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of\\nthine house hath eaten me up.\\n\\n Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou\\nunto us, seeing that thou doest these things?   Jesus answered and\\nsaid unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it\\nup.\\n\\n Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in\\nbuilding, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?   But he spake\\nof the temple of his body.\\n\\n When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples\\nremembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the\\nscripture, and the word which Jesus had said.\\n\\n Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day,\\nmany believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.\\n\\n But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all\\nmen,  And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew\\nwhat was in man.\\n\\n There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the\\nJews:  The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi,\\nwe know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these\\nmiracles that thou doest, except God be with him.\\n\\n Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee,\\nExcept a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\\n\\n Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old?\\ncan he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?  \\nJesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born\\nof water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\\n\\n That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born\\nof the Spirit is spirit.\\n\\n Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.\\n\\n The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound\\nthereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so\\nis every one that is born of the Spirit.\\n\\n Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?\\n Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel,\\nand knowest not these things?   Verily, verily, I say unto thee,\\nWe speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye\\nreceive not our witness.\\n\\n If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall\\nye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?   And no man hath\\nascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son\\nof man which is in heaven.\\n\\n And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so\\nmust the Son of man be lifted up:  That whosoever believeth in him\\nshould not perish, but have eternal life.\\n\\n For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,\\nthat whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have\\neverlasting life.\\n\\n For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but\\nthat the world through him might be saved.\\n\\n He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth\\nnot is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of\\nthe only begotten Son of God.\\n\\n And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world,\\nand men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were\\nevil.\\n\\n For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to\\nthe light, lest his deeds should be reproved.\\n\\n But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may\\nbe made manifest, that they are wrought in God.\\n\\n After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of\\nJudaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.\\n\\n And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there\\nwas much water there: and they came, and were baptized.\\n\\n For John was not yet cast into prison.\\n\\n Then there arose a question between some of John’s disciples and\\nthe Jews about purifying.\\n\\n And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was\\nwith thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same\\nbaptizeth, and all men come to him.\\n\\n John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be\\ngiven him from heaven.\\n\\n Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ,\\nbut that I am sent before him.\\n\\n He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the\\nbridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because\\nof the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.\\n\\n He must increase, but I must decrease.\\n\\n He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth\\nis earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is\\nabove all.\\n\\n And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man\\nreceiveth his testimony.\\n\\n He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God\\nis true.\\n\\n For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God\\ngiveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.\\n\\n The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his\\nhand.\\n\\n He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that\\nbelieveth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth\\non him.\\n\\n When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that\\nJesus made and baptized more disciples than John,  (Though Jesus\\nhimself baptized not, but his disciples,)  He left Judaea, and\\ndeparted again into Galilee.\\n\\n And he must needs go through Samaria.\\n\\n Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near\\nto the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.\\n\\n Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with\\nhis journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.\\n\\n There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto\\nher, Give me to drink.\\n\\n (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)  \\nThen saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a\\nJew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews\\nhave no dealings with the Samaritans.\\n\\n Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of\\nGod, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest\\nhave asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.\\n\\n The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with,\\nand the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?\\n Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well,\\nand drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?  \\nJesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water\\nshall thirst again:  But whosoever drinketh of the water that I\\nshall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him\\nshall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.\\n\\n The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst\\nnot, neither come hither to draw.\\n\\n Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.\\n\\n The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto\\nher, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:  For thou hast had\\nfive husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that\\nsaidst thou truly.\\n\\n The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a\\nprophet.\\n\\n Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in\\nJerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.\\n\\n Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye\\nshall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the\\nFather.\\n\\n Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for\\nsalvation is of the Jews.\\n\\n But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall\\nworship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such\\nto worship him.\\n\\n God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in\\nspirit and in truth.\\n\\n The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is\\ncalled Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.\\n\\n Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.\\n\\n And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked\\nwith the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest\\nthou with her?   The woman then left her waterpot, and went her\\nway into the city, and saith to the men,  Come, see a man, which\\ntold me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?   Then\\nthey went out of the city, and came unto him.\\n\\n In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.\\n\\n But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.\\n\\n Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought\\nhim ought to eat?   Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the\\nwill of him that sent me, and to finish his work.\\n\\n Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest?\\nbehold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for\\nthey are white already to harvest.\\n\\n And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto\\nlife eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice\\ntogether.\\n\\n And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.\\n\\n I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men\\nlaboured, and ye are entered into their labours.\\n\\n And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the\\nsaying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.\\n\\n So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that\\nhe would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.\\n\\n And many more believed because of his own word;  And said\\nunto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have\\nheard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the\\nSaviour of the world.\\n\\n Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.\\n\\n For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his\\nown country.\\n\\n Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him,\\nhaving seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for\\nthey also went unto the feast.\\n\\n So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water\\nwine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at\\nCapernaum.\\n\\n When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he\\nwent unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his\\nson: for he was at the point of death.\\n\\n Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye\\nwill not believe.\\n\\n The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.\\n\\n Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man\\nbelieved the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.\\n\\n And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him,\\nsaying, Thy son liveth.\\n\\n Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And\\nthey said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.\\n\\n So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which\\nJesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his\\nwhole house.\\n\\n This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come\\nout of Judaea into Galilee.\\n\\n After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to\\nJerusalem.\\n\\n Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is\\ncalled in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.\\n\\n In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt,\\nwithered, waiting for the moving of the water.\\n\\n For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and\\ntroubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the\\nwater stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.\\n\\n And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and\\neight years.\\n\\n When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time\\nin that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?   The\\nimpotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is\\ntroubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another\\nsteppeth down before me.\\n\\n Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.\\n\\n And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and\\nwalked: and on the same day was the sabbath.\\n\\n The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the\\nsabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.\\n\\n He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me,\\nTake up thy bed, and walk.\\n\\n Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take\\nup thy bed, and walk?   And he that was healed wist not who it\\nwas: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that\\nplace.\\n\\n Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him,\\nBehold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto\\nthee.\\n\\n The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had\\nmade him whole.\\n\\n And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay\\nhim, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.\\n\\n But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.\\n\\n Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not\\nonly had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father,\\nmaking himself equal with God.\\n\\n Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say\\nunto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the\\nFather do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son\\nlikewise.\\n\\n For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that\\nhimself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye\\nmay marvel.\\n\\n For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even\\nso the Son quickeneth whom he will.\\n\\n For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment\\nunto the Son:  That all men should honour the Son, even as they\\nhonour the Father.\\n\\nHe that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent\\nhim.\\n\\n Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and\\nbelieveth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not\\ncome into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.\\n\\n Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is,\\nwhen the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that\\nhear shall live.\\n\\n For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the\\nSon to have life in himself;  And hath given him authority to\\nexecute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.\\n\\n Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that\\nare in the graves shall hear his voice,  And shall come forth;\\nthey that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that\\nhave done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.\\n\\n I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my\\njudgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of\\nthe Father which hath sent me.\\n\\n If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.\\n\\n There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the\\nwitness which he witnesseth of me is true.\\n\\n Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.\\n\\n But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say,\\nthat ye might be saved.\\n\\n He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a\\nseason to rejoice in his light.\\n\\n But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which\\nthe Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear\\nwitness of me, that the Father hath sent me.\\n\\n And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of\\nme.\\n\\nYe have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.\\n\\n And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent,\\nhim ye believe not.\\n\\n Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life:\\nand they are they which testify of me.\\n\\n And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.\\n\\n I receive not honour from men.\\n\\n But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.\\n\\n I am come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if another\\nshall come in his own name, him ye will receive.\\n\\n How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek\\nnot the honour that cometh from God only?   Do not think that I\\nwill accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even\\nMoses, in whom ye trust.\\n\\n For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he\\nwrote of me.\\n\\n But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my\\nwords?   After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee,\\nwhich is the sea of Tiberias.\\n\\n And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles\\nwhich he did on them that were diseased.\\n\\n And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his\\ndisciples.\\n\\n And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.\\n\\n When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come\\nunto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these\\nmay eat?   And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what\\nhe would do.\\n\\n Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not\\nsufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.\\n\\n One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, saith unto\\nhim,  There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two\\nsmall fishes: but what are they among so many?   And Jesus said,\\nMake the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the\\nmen sat down, in number about five thousand.\\n\\n And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he\\ndistributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set\\ndown; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.\\n\\n When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the\\nfragments that remain, that nothing be lost.\\n\\n Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets\\nwith the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and\\nabove unto them that had eaten.\\n\\n Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did,\\nsaid, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.\\n\\n When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him\\nby force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain\\nhimself alone.\\n\\n And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea,\\n And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum.\\nAnd it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.\\n\\n And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.\\n\\n So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs,\\nthey see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and\\nthey were afraid.\\n\\n But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.\\n\\n Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately\\nthe ship was at the land whither they went.\\n\\n The day following, when the people which stood on the other side\\nof the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one\\nwhereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his\\ndisciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;\\n (Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place\\nwhere they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:) \\nWhen the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his\\ndisciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for\\nJesus.\\n\\n And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they\\nsaid unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?   Jesus answered\\nthem and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because\\nye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were\\nfilled.\\n\\n Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which\\nendureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto\\nyou: for him hath God the Father sealed.\\n\\n Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the\\nworks of God?   Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the\\nwork of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.\\n\\n They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that\\nwe may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?   Our fathers\\ndid eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from\\nheaven to eat.\\n\\n Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses\\ngave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true\\nbread from heaven.\\n\\n For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and\\ngiveth life unto the world.\\n\\n Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.\\n\\n And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh\\nto me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never\\nthirst.\\n\\n But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.\\n\\n All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that\\ncometh to me I will in no wise cast out.\\n\\n For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the\\nwill of him that sent me.\\n\\n And this is the Father’s will which hath sent me, that of all\\nwhich he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up\\nagain at the last day.\\n\\n And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which\\nseeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I\\nwill raise him up at the last day.\\n\\n The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread\\nwhich came down from heaven.\\n\\n And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father\\nand mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from\\nheaven?   Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not\\namong yourselves.\\n\\n No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw\\nhim: and I will raise him up at the last day.\\n\\n It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of\\nGod.\\n\\nEvery man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father,\\ncometh unto me.\\n\\n Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God,\\nhe hath seen the Father.\\n\\n Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath\\neverlasting life.\\n\\n I am that bread of life.\\n\\n Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.\\n\\n This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may\\neat thereof, and not die.\\n\\n I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat\\nof this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give\\nis my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.\\n\\n The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this\\nman give us his flesh to eat?   Then Jesus said unto them, Verily,\\nverily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and\\ndrink his blood, ye have no life in you.\\n\\n Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life;\\nand I will raise him up at the last day.\\n\\n For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.\\n\\n He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me,\\nand I in him.\\n\\n As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so\\nhe that eateth me, even he shall live by me.\\n\\n This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your\\nfathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread\\nshall live for ever.\\n\\n These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.\\n\\n Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said,\\nThis is an hard saying; who can hear it?   When Jesus knew in\\nhimself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth\\nthis offend you?   What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend\\nup where he was before?   It is the spirit that quickeneth; the\\nflesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are\\nspirit, and they are life.\\n\\n But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from\\nthe beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray\\nhim.\\n\\n And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto\\nme, except it were given unto him of my Father.\\n\\n From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no\\nmore with him.\\n\\n Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?   Then\\nSimon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the\\nwords of eternal life.\\n\\n And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of\\nthe living God.\\n\\n Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you\\nis a devil?   He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he\\nit was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.\\n\\n After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk\\nin Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.\\n\\n Now the Jew’s feast of tabernacles was at hand.\\n\\n His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into\\nJudaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.\\n\\n For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself\\nseeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to\\nthe world.\\n\\n For neither did his brethren believe in him.\\n\\n Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time\\nis alway ready.\\n\\n The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of\\nit, that the works thereof are evil.\\n\\n Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for my\\ntime is not yet full come.\\n\\n When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.\\n\\n But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the\\nfeast, not openly, but as it were in secret.\\n\\n Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?\\n And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for\\nsome said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the\\npeople.\\n\\n Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.\\n\\n Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple,\\nand taught.\\n\\n And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters,\\nhaving never learned?   Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine\\nis not mine, but his that sent me.\\n\\n If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine,\\nwhether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.\\n\\n He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that\\nseeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no\\nunrighteousness is in him.\\n\\n Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the\\nlaw?  Why go ye about to kill me?   The people answered and said,\\nThou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?   Jesus answered\\nand said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.\\n\\n Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of\\nMoses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a\\nman.\\n\\n If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of\\nMoses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a\\nman every whit whole on the sabbath day?   Judge not according to\\nthe appearance, but judge righteous judgment.\\n\\n Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they\\nseek to kill?   But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing\\nunto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?\\n Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no\\nman knoweth whence he is.\\n\\n Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know\\nme, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that\\nsent me is true, whom ye know not.\\n\\n But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.\\n\\n Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him,\\nbecause his hour was not yet come.\\n\\n And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ\\ncometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?\\n The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things\\nconcerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers\\nto take him.\\n\\n Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and\\nthen I go unto him that sent me.\\n\\n Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither\\nye cannot come.\\n\\n Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we\\nshall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles,\\nand teach the Gentiles?   What manner of saying is this that he\\nsaid, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither\\nye cannot come?   In the last day, that great day of the feast,\\nJesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto\\nme, and drink.\\n\\n He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his\\nbelly shall flow rivers of living water.\\n\\n (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him\\nshould receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that\\nJesus was not yet glorified.)   Many of the people therefore, when\\nthey heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.\\n\\n Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come\\nout of Galilee?   Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh\\nof the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David\\nwas?   So there was a division among the people because of him.\\n\\n And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on\\nhim.\\n\\n Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and\\nthey said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?   The officers\\nanswered, Never man spake like this man.\\n\\n Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?  \\nHave any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?   But\\nthis people who knoweth not the law are cursed.\\n\\n Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being\\none of them,)  Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and\\nknow what he doeth?   They answered and said unto him, Art thou\\nalso of Galilee?  Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no\\nprophet.\\n\\n And every man went unto his own house.\\n\\n Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.\\n\\n And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all\\nthe people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.\\n\\n And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in\\nadultery; and when they had set her in the midst,  They say unto\\nhim, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.\\n\\n Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but\\nwhat sayest thou?   This they said, tempting him, that they might\\nhave to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote\\non the ground, as though he heard them not.\\n\\n So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said\\nunto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a\\nstone at her.\\n\\n And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.\\n\\n And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience,\\nwent out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and\\nJesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.\\n\\n When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he\\nsaid unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man\\ncondemned thee?   She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her,\\nNeither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.\\n\\n Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the\\nworld: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have\\nthe light of life.\\n\\n The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of\\nthyself; thy record is not true.\\n\\n Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of\\nmyself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I\\ngo; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.\\n\\n Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.\\n\\n And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but\\nI and the Father that sent me.\\n\\n It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is\\ntrue.\\n\\n I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me\\nbeareth witness of me.\\n\\n Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye\\nneither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have\\nknown my Father also.\\n\\n These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the\\ntemple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.\\n\\n Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek\\nme, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.\\n\\n Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith,\\nWhither I go, ye cannot come.\\n\\n And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye\\nare of this world; I am not of this world.\\n\\n I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if\\nye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.\\n\\n Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them,\\nEven the same that I said unto you from the beginning.\\n\\n I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent\\nme is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard\\nof him.\\n\\n They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.\\n\\n Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man,\\nthen shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but\\nas my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.\\n\\n And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me\\nalone; for I do always those things that please him.\\n\\n As he spake these words, many believed on him.\\n\\n Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye\\ncontinue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;  And ye\\nshall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.\\n\\n They answered him, We be Abraham’s seed, and were never in\\nbondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?  \\nJesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever\\ncommitteth sin is the servant of sin.\\n\\n And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son\\nabideth ever.\\n\\n If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free\\nindeed.\\n\\n I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; but ye seek to kill me,\\nbecause my word hath no place in you.\\n\\n I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that\\nwhich ye have seen with your father.\\n\\n They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus\\nsaith unto them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works\\nof Abraham.\\n\\n But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth,\\nwhich I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.\\n\\n Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not\\nborn of fornication; we have one Father, even God.\\n\\n Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me:\\nfor I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but\\nhe sent me.\\n\\n Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear\\nmy word.\\n\\n Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye\\nwill do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the\\ntruth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he\\nspeaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.\\n\\n And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.\\n\\n Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do\\nye not believe me?   He that is of God heareth God’s words: ye\\ntherefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.\\n\\n Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that\\nthou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?   Jesus answered, I have\\nnot a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.\\n\\n And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and\\njudgeth.\\n\\n Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall\\nnever see death.\\n\\n Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil.\\n\\nAbraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my\\nsaying, he shall never taste of death.\\n\\n Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the\\nprophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?   Jesus answered, If\\nI honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth\\nme; of whom ye say, that he is your God:  Yet ye have not known\\nhim; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a\\nliar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.\\n\\n Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and\\nwas glad.\\n\\n Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old,\\nand hast thou seen Abraham?   Jesus said unto them, Verily,\\nverily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.\\n\\n Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself,\\nand went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so\\npassed by.\\n\\n And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his\\nbirth.\\n\\n And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this\\nman, or his parents, that he was born blind?   Jesus answered,\\nNeither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of\\nGod should be made manifest in him.\\n\\n I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the\\nnight cometh, when no man can work.\\n\\n As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.\\n\\n When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of\\nthe spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,\\n And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by\\ninterpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came\\nseeing.\\n\\n The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that\\nhe was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?   Some\\nsaid, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.\\n\\n Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?  \\nHe answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and\\nanointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and\\nwash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.\\n\\n Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.\\n\\n They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.\\n\\n And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened\\nhis eyes.\\n\\n Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his\\nsight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed,\\nand do see.\\n\\n Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God,\\nbecause he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man\\nthat is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among\\nthem.\\n\\n They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that\\nhe hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.\\n\\n But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been\\nblind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him\\nthat had received his sight.\\n\\n And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was\\nborn blind? how then doth he now see?   His parents answered them\\nand said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:\\n But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened\\nhis eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for\\nhimself.\\n\\n These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for\\nthe Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was\\nChrist, he should be put out of the synagogue.\\n\\n Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.\\n\\n Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him,\\nGive God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.\\n\\n He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not:\\none thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.\\n\\n Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he\\nthine eyes?   He answered them, I have told you already, and ye\\ndid not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his\\ndisciples?   Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his\\ndisciple; but we are Moses’ disciples.\\n\\n We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know\\nnot from whence he is.\\n\\n The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous\\nthing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine\\neyes.\\n\\n Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a\\nworshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.\\n\\n Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the\\neyes of one that was born blind.\\n\\n If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.\\n\\n They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in\\nsins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.\\n\\n Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found\\nhim, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?   He\\nanswered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?  \\nAnd Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that\\ntalketh with thee.\\n\\n And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.\\n\\n And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they\\nwhich see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.\\n\\n And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words,\\nand said unto him, Are we blind also?   Jesus said unto them, If\\nye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see;\\ntherefore your sin remaineth.\\n\\n Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door\\ninto the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a\\nthief and a robber.\\n\\n But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.\\n\\n To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he\\ncalleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.\\n\\n And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them,\\nand the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.\\n\\n And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for\\nthey know not the voice of strangers.\\n\\n This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what\\nthings they were which he spake unto them.\\n\\n Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you,\\nI am the door of the sheep.\\n\\n All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the\\nsheep did not hear them.\\n\\n I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and\\nshall go in and out, and find pasture.\\n\\n The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to\\ndestroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have\\nit more abundantly.\\n\\n I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for\\nthe sheep.\\n\\n But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the\\nsheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and\\nfleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.\\n\\n The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not\\nfor the sheep.\\n\\n I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.\\n\\n As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay\\ndown my life for the sheep.\\n\\n And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I\\nmust bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold,\\nand one shepherd.\\n\\n Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life,\\nthat I might take it again.\\n\\n No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have\\npower to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This\\ncommandment have I received of my Father.\\n\\n There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these\\nsayings.\\n\\n And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye\\nhim?   Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a\\ndevil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?   And it was at\\nJerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.\\n\\n And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon’s porch.\\n\\n Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long\\ndost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.\\n\\n Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works\\nthat I do in my Father’s name, they bear witness of me.\\n\\n But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said\\nunto you.\\n\\n My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:\\n And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish,\\nneither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.\\n\\n My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man\\nis able to pluck them out of my Father’s hand.\\n\\n I and my Father are one.\\n\\n Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.\\n\\n Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my\\nFather; for which of those works do ye stone me?   The Jews\\nanswered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for\\nblasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.\\n\\n Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye\\nare gods?   If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God\\ncame, and the scripture cannot be broken;  Say ye of him, whom\\nthe Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest;\\nbecause I said, I am the Son of God?   If I do not the works of\\nmy Father, believe me not.\\n\\n But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that\\nye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.\\n\\n Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of\\ntheir hand,  And went away again beyond Jordan into the place\\nwhere John at first baptized; and there he abode.\\n\\n And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but\\nall things that John spake of this man were true.\\n\\n And many believed on him there.\\n\\n Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town\\nof Mary and her sister Martha.\\n\\n (It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and\\nwiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)  \\nTherefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom\\nthou lovest is sick.\\n\\n When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death,\\nbut for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified\\nthereby.\\n\\n Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.\\n\\n When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days\\nstill in the same place where he was.\\n\\n Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea\\nagain.\\n\\n His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to\\nstone thee; and goest thou thither again?   Jesus answered, Are\\nthere not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he\\nstumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.\\n\\n But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is\\nno light in him.\\n\\n These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our\\nfriend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.\\n\\n Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.\\n\\n Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had\\nspoken of taking of rest in sleep.\\n\\n Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.\\n\\n And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent\\nye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.\\n\\n Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his\\nfellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.\\n\\n Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave\\nfour days already.\\n\\n Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:\\n And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them\\nconcerning their brother.\\n\\n Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went\\nand met him: but Mary sat still in the house.\\n\\n Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my\\nbrother had not died.\\n\\n But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God\\nwill give it thee.\\n\\n Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.\\n\\n Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the\\nresurrection at the last day.\\n\\n Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he\\nthat believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: \\nAnd whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest\\nthou this?   She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou\\nart the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.\\n\\n And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her\\nsister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.\\n\\n As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.\\n\\n Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place\\nwhere Martha met him.\\n\\n The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted\\nher, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out,\\nfollowed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.\\n\\n Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell\\ndown at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my\\nbrother had not died.\\n\\n When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping\\nwhich came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled.\\n\\n And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come\\nand see.\\n\\n Jesus wept.\\n\\n Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!   And some of\\nthem said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind,\\nhave caused that even this man should not have died?   Jesus\\ntherefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a\\ncave, and a stone lay upon it.\\n\\n Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him\\nthat was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he\\nhath been dead four days.\\n\\n Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou\\nwouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?   Then\\nthey took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And\\nJesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou\\nhast heard me.\\n\\n And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the\\npeople which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast\\nsent me.\\n\\n And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice,\\nLazarus, come forth.\\n\\n And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with\\ngraveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith\\nunto them, Loose him, and let him go.\\n\\n Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the\\nthings which Jesus did, believed on him.\\n\\n But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them\\nwhat things Jesus had done.\\n\\n Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and\\nsaid, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.\\n\\n If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the\\nRomans shall come and take away both our place and nation.\\n\\n And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same\\nyear, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,  Nor consider that\\nit is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and\\nthat the whole nation perish not.\\n\\n And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that\\nyear, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;  And\\nnot for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in\\none the children of God that were scattered abroad.\\n\\n Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put\\nhim to death.\\n\\n Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went\\nthence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called\\nEphraim, and there continued with his disciples.\\n\\n And the Jews’ passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of\\nthe country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.\\n\\n Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they\\nstood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the\\nfeast?   Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a\\ncommandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it,\\nthat they might take him.\\n\\n Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where\\nLazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.\\n\\n There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was\\none of them that sat at the table with him.\\n\\n Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and\\nanointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the\\nhouse was filled with the odour of the ointment.\\n\\n Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son,\\nwhich should betray him,  Why was not this ointment sold for three\\nhundred pence, and given to the poor?   This he said, not that he\\ncared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and\\nbare what was put therein.\\n\\n Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying\\nhath she kept this.\\n\\n For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.\\n\\n Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and\\nthey came not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus\\nalso, whom he had raised from the dead.\\n\\n But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also\\nto death;  Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went\\naway, and believed on Jesus.\\n\\n On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when\\nthey heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,  Took branches of\\npalm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is\\nthe King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.\\n\\n And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is\\nwritten,  Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh,\\nsitting on an ass’s colt.\\n\\n These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when\\nJesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were\\nwritten of him, and that they had done these things unto him.\\n\\n The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus\\nout of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.\\n\\n For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that\\nhe had done this miracle.\\n\\n The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how\\nye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.\\n\\n And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship\\nat the feast:  The same came therefore to Philip, which was of\\nBethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see\\nJesus.\\n\\n Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip\\ntell Jesus.\\n\\n And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son\\nof man should be glorified.\\n\\n Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into\\nthe ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth\\nmuch fruit.\\n\\n He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his\\nlife in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.\\n\\n If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there\\nshall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father\\nhonour.\\n\\n Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me\\nfrom this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.\\n\\n Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven,\\nsaying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.\\n\\n The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it\\nthundered: others said, An angel spake to him.\\n\\n Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but\\nfor your sakes.\\n\\n Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this\\nworld be cast out.\\n\\n And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto\\nme.\\n\\n This he said, signifying what death he should die.\\n\\n The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that\\nChrist abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be\\nlifted up? who is this Son of man?   Then Jesus said unto them,\\nYet a little while is the light with you.\\n\\nWalk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that\\nwalketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.\\n\\n While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the\\nchildren of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did\\nhide himself from them.\\n\\n But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they\\nbelieved not on him:  That the saying of Esaias the prophet might\\nbe fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and\\nto whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?   Therefore they\\ncould not believe, because that Esaias said again,  He hath\\nblinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see\\nwith their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted,\\nand I should heal them.\\n\\n These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of\\nhim.\\n\\n Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him;\\nbut because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they\\nshould be put out of the synagogue:  For they loved the praise of\\nmen more than the praise of God.\\n\\n Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on\\nme, but on him that sent me.\\n\\n And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.\\n\\n I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me\\nshould not abide in darkness.\\n\\n And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not:\\nfor I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.\\n\\n He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that\\njudgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in\\nthe last day.\\n\\n For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me,\\nhe gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.\\n\\n And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever\\nI speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.\\n\\n Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his\\nhour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father,\\nhaving loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the\\nend.\\n\\n And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart\\nof Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, to betray him;  Jesus knowing that\\nthe Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come\\nfrom God, and went to God;  He riseth from supper, and laid aside\\nhis garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.\\n\\n After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the\\ndisciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was\\ngirded.\\n\\n Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord,\\ndost thou wash my feet?   Jesus answered and said unto him, What I\\ndo thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.\\n\\n Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus\\nanswered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.\\n\\n Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my\\nhands and my head.\\n\\n Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash\\nhis feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.\\n\\n For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not\\nall clean.\\n\\n So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments,\\nand was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to\\nyou?   Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.\\n\\n If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also\\nought to wash one another’s feet.\\n\\n For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have\\ndone to you.\\n\\n Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than\\nhis lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.\\n\\n If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.\\n\\n I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the\\nscripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted\\nup his heel against me.\\n\\n Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye\\nmay believe that I am he.\\n\\n Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I\\nsend receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent\\nme.\\n\\n When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and\\ntestified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you\\nshall betray me.\\n\\n Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he\\nspake.\\n\\n Now there was leaning on Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, whom\\nJesus loved.\\n\\n Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it\\nshould be of whom he spake.\\n\\n He then lying on Jesus’ breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?\\n Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I\\nhave dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas\\nIscariot, the son of Simon.\\n\\n And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto\\nhim, That thou doest, do quickly.\\n\\n Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto\\nhim.\\n\\n For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus\\nhad said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the\\nfeast; or, that he should give something to the poor.\\n\\n He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was\\nnight.\\n\\n Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of\\nman glorified, and God is glorified in him.\\n\\n If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in\\nhimself, and shall straightway glorify him.\\n\\n Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek\\nme: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now\\nI say to you.\\n\\n A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as\\nI have loved you, that ye also love one another.\\n\\n By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have\\nlove one to another.\\n\\n Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus\\nanswered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou\\nshalt follow me afterwards.\\n\\n Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will\\nlay down my life for thy sake.\\n\\n Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake?\\nVerily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou\\nhast denied me thrice.\\n\\n Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also\\nin me.\\n\\n In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I\\nwould have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.\\n\\n And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and\\nreceive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.\\n\\n And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.\\n\\n Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and\\nhow can we know the way?   Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the\\ntruth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\\n\\n If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from\\nhenceforth ye know him, and have seen him.\\n\\n Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth\\nus.\\n\\n Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet\\nhast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the\\nFather; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?   Believest\\nthou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?  the words\\nthat I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that\\ndwelleth in me, he doeth the works.\\n\\n Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or\\nelse believe me for the very works’ sake.\\n\\n Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the\\nworks that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall\\nhe do; because I go unto my Father.\\n\\n And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the\\nFather may be glorified in the Son.\\n\\n If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.\\n\\n If ye love me, keep my commandments.\\n\\n And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another\\nComforter, that he may abide with you for ever;  Even the Spirit\\nof truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not,\\nneither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and\\nshall be in you.\\n\\n I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.\\n\\n Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see\\nme: because I live, ye shall live also.\\n\\n At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me,\\nand I in you.\\n\\n He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that\\nloveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I\\nwill love him, and will manifest myself to him.\\n\\n Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou\\nwilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?   Jesus\\nanswered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words:\\nand my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our\\nabode with him.\\n\\n He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which\\nye hear is not mine, but the Father’s which sent me.\\n\\n These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you.\\n\\n But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will\\nsend in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things\\nto your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\\n\\n Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the\\nworld giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither\\nlet it be afraid.\\n\\n Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again\\nunto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto\\nthe Father: for my Father is greater than I.\\n\\n And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is\\ncome to pass, ye might believe.\\n\\n Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this\\nworld cometh, and hath nothing in me.\\n\\n But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the\\nFather gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.\\n\\n I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.\\n\\n Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and\\nevery branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring\\nforth more fruit.\\n\\n Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.\\n\\n Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of\\nitself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide\\nin me.\\n\\n I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I\\nin him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do\\nnothing.\\n\\n If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is\\nwithered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they\\nare burned.\\n\\n If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what\\nye will, and it shall be done unto you.\\n\\n Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall\\nye be my disciples.\\n\\n As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in\\nmy love.\\n\\n If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I\\nhave kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love.\\n\\n These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in\\nyou, and that your joy might be full.\\n\\n This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have\\nloved you.\\n\\n Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life\\nfor his friends.\\n\\n Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.\\n\\n Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not\\nwhat his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things\\nthat I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.\\n\\n Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you,\\nthat ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should\\nremain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may\\ngive it you.\\n\\n These things I command you, that ye love one another.\\n\\n If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated\\nyou.\\n\\n If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but\\nbecause ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the\\nworld, therefore the world hateth you.\\n\\n Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not\\ngreater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also\\npersecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.\\n\\n But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake,\\nbecause they know not him that sent me.\\n\\n If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin:\\nbut now they have no cloak for their sin.\\n\\n He that hateth me hateth my Father also.\\n\\n If I had not done among them the works which none other man did,\\nthey had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me\\nand my Father.\\n\\n But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that\\nis written in their law, They hated me without a cause.\\n\\n But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from\\nthe Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the\\nFather, he shall testify of me:  And ye also shall bear witness,\\nbecause ye have been with me from the beginning.\\n\\n These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be\\noffended.\\n\\n They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh,\\nthat whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.\\n\\n And these things will they do unto you, because they have not\\nknown the Father, nor me.\\n\\n But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come,\\nye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not\\nunto you at the beginning, because I was with you.\\n\\n But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh\\nme, Whither goest thou?   But because I have said these things\\nunto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.\\n\\n Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I\\ngo away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you;\\nbut if I depart, I will send him unto you.\\n\\n And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of\\nrighteousness, and of judgment:  Of sin, because they believe not\\non me;  Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see\\nme no more;  Of judgment, because the prince of this world is\\njudged.\\n\\n I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them\\nnow.\\n\\n Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you\\ninto all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he\\nshall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.\\n\\n He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall\\nshew it unto you.\\n\\n All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that\\nhe shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.\\n\\n A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little\\nwhile, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.\\n\\n Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this\\nthat he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and\\nagain, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the\\nFather?   They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A\\nlittle while? we cannot tell what he saith.\\n\\n Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto\\nthem, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while,\\nand ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see\\nme?   Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and\\nlament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but\\nyour sorrow shall be turned into joy.\\n\\n A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is\\ncome: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no\\nmore the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.\\n\\n And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and\\nyour heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.\\n\\n And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say\\nunto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give\\nit you.\\n\\n Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall\\nreceive, that your joy may be full.\\n\\n These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time\\ncometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall\\nshew you plainly of the Father.\\n\\n At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you,\\nthat I will pray the Father for you:  For the Father himself\\nloveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came\\nout from God.\\n\\n I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again,\\nI leave the world, and go to the Father.\\n\\n His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and\\nspeakest no proverb.\\n\\n Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not\\nthat any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest\\nforth from God.\\n\\n Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?   Behold, the hour\\ncometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his\\nown, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the\\nFather is with me.\\n\\n These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have\\npeace.\\n\\nIn the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have\\novercome the world.\\n\\n These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and\\nsaid, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may\\nglorify thee:  As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that\\nhe should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.\\n\\n And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true\\nGod, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.\\n\\n I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work\\nwhich thou gavest me to do.\\n\\n And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the\\nglory which I had with thee before the world was.\\n\\n I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out\\nof the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have\\nkept thy word.\\n\\n Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me\\nare of thee.\\n\\n For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and\\nthey have received them, and have known surely that I came out from\\nthee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.\\n\\n I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which\\nthou hast given me; for they are thine.\\n\\n And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified\\nin them.\\n\\n And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world,\\nand I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those\\nwhom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.\\n\\n While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name:\\nthose that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but\\nthe son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.\\n\\n And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world,\\nthat they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.\\n\\n I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them,\\nbecause they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.\\n\\n I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but\\nthat thou shouldest keep them from the evil.\\n\\n They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.\\n\\n Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.\\n\\n As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent\\nthem into the world.\\n\\n And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be\\nsanctified through the truth.\\n\\n Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall\\nbelieve on me through their word;  That they all may be one; as\\nthou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in\\nus: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.\\n\\n And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they\\nmay be one, even as we are one:  I in them, and thou in me, that\\nthey may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou\\nhast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.\\n\\n Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with\\nme where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given\\nme: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.\\n\\n O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have\\nknown thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.\\n\\n And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it:\\nthat the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in\\nthem.\\n\\n When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his\\ndisciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he\\nentered, and his disciples.\\n\\n And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus\\nofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.\\n\\n Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the\\nchief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches\\nand weapons.\\n\\n Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him,\\nwent forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?   They answered him,\\nJesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he.\\n\\nAnd Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.\\n\\n As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went\\nbackward, and fell to the ground.\\n\\n Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of\\nNazareth.\\n\\n Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye\\nseek me, let these go their way:  That the saying might be\\nfulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost\\nnone.\\n\\n Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high\\npriest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was\\nMalchus.\\n\\n Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath:\\nthe cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?  \\nThen the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and\\nbound him,  And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in\\nlaw to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.\\n\\n Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was\\nexpedient that one man should die for the people.\\n\\n And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple:\\nthat disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus\\ninto the palace of the high priest.\\n\\n But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other\\ndisciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her\\nthat kept the door, and brought in Peter.\\n\\n Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not\\nthou also one of this man’s disciples? He saith, I am not.\\n\\n And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire\\nof coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood\\nwith them, and warmed himself.\\n\\n The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his\\ndoctrine.\\n\\n Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught\\nin the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort;\\nand in secret have I said nothing.\\n\\n Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said\\nunto them: behold, they know what I said.\\n\\n And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by\\nstruck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the\\nhigh priest so?   Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear\\nwitness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?   Now\\nAnnas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.\\n\\n And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore\\nunto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and\\nsaid, I am not.\\n\\n One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose\\near Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?\\n Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.\\n\\n Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and\\nit was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall,\\nlest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.\\n\\n Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring\\nye against this man?   They answered and said unto him, If he\\nwere not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.\\n\\n Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according\\nto your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us\\nto put any man to death:  That the saying of Jesus might be\\nfulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.\\n\\n Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called\\nJesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?   Jesus\\nanswered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it\\nthee of me?   Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and\\nthe chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?\\n Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom\\nwere of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be\\ndelivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.\\n\\n Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus\\nanswered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and\\nfor this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto\\nthe truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.\\n\\n Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this,\\nhe went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no\\nfault at all.\\n\\n But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the\\npassover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the\\nJews?   Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but\\nBarabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.\\n\\n Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.\\n\\n And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his\\nhead, and they put on him a purple robe,  And said, Hail, King of\\nthe Jews! and they smote him with their hands.\\n\\n Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I\\nbring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.\\n\\n Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the\\npurple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!   When\\nthe chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out,\\nsaying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him,\\nand crucify him: for I find no fault in him.\\n\\n The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to\\ndie, because he made himself the Son of God.\\n\\n When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;\\n And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus,\\nWhence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.\\n\\n Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest\\nthou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release\\nthee?   Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all\\nagainst me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that\\ndelivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.\\n\\n And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews\\ncried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar’s\\nfriend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.\\n\\n When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth,\\nand sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the\\nPavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.\\n\\n And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth\\nhour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!   But they\\ncried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him.\\n\\nPilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests\\nanswered, We have no king but Caesar.\\n\\n Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And\\nthey took Jesus, and led him away.\\n\\n And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the\\nplace of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:  Where\\nthey crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and\\nJesus in the midst.\\n\\n And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the\\nwriting was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.\\n\\n This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus\\nwas crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and\\nGreek, and Latin.\\n\\n Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not,\\nThe King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.\\n\\n Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.\\n\\n Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his\\ngarments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his\\ncoat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.\\n\\n They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but\\ncast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be\\nfulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my\\nvesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.\\n\\n Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his\\nmother’s sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.\\n\\n When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing\\nby, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!\\n Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that\\nhour that disciple took her unto his own home.\\n\\n After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished,\\nthat the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.\\n\\n Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a\\nspunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.\\n\\n When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is\\nfinished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.\\n\\n The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the\\nbodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that\\nsabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be\\nbroken, and that they might be taken away.\\n\\n Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of\\nthe other which was crucified with him.\\n\\n But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already,\\nthey brake not his legs:  But one of the soldiers with a spear\\npierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.\\n\\n And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he\\nknoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.\\n\\n For these things were done, that the scripture should be\\nfulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.\\n\\n And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom\\nthey pierced.\\n\\n And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus,\\nbut secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take\\naway the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore,\\nand took the body of Jesus.\\n\\n And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus\\nby night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred\\npound weight.\\n\\n Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes\\nwith the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.\\n\\n Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and\\nin the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.\\n\\n There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews’ preparation\\nday; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.\\n\\n The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it\\nwas yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from\\nthe sepulchre.\\n\\n Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other\\ndisciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away\\nthe LORD out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid\\nhim.\\n\\n Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to\\nthe sepulchre.\\n\\n So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun\\nPeter, and came first to the sepulchre.\\n\\n And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes\\nlying; yet went he not in.\\n\\n Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the\\nsepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,  And the napkin, that\\nwas about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped\\ntogether in a place by itself.\\n\\n Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the\\nsepulchre, and he saw, and believed.\\n\\n For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again\\nfrom the dead.\\n\\n Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.\\n\\n But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she\\nwept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre,  And seeth\\ntwo angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the\\nfeet, where the body of Jesus had lain.\\n\\n And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto\\nthem, Because they have taken away my LORD, and I know not where they\\nhave laid him.\\n\\n And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw\\nJesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.\\n\\n Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest\\nthou?  She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if\\nthou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I\\nwill take him away.\\n\\n Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto\\nhim, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.\\n\\n Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to\\nmy Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my\\nFather, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.\\n\\n Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the\\nLORD, and that he had spoken these things unto her.\\n\\n Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week,\\nwhen the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear\\nof the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them,\\nPeace be unto you.\\n\\n And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his\\nside.\\n\\nThen were the disciples glad, when they saw the LORD.\\n\\n Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father\\nhath sent me, even so send I you.\\n\\n And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto\\nthem, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:  Whose soever sins ye remit,\\nthey are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are\\nretained.\\n\\n But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them\\nwhen Jesus came.\\n\\n The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the\\nLORD.\\n\\nBut he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of\\nthe nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust\\nmy hand into his side, I will not believe.\\n\\n And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas\\nwith them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the\\nmidst, and said, Peace be unto you.\\n\\n Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my\\nhands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be\\nnot faithless, but believing.\\n\\n And Thomas answered and said unto him, My LORD and my God.\\n\\n Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou\\nhast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have\\nbelieved.\\n\\n And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his\\ndisciples, which are not written in this book:  But these are\\nwritten, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of\\nGod; and that believing ye might have life through his name.\\n\\n After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at\\nthe sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself.\\n\\n There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and\\nNathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other\\nof his disciples.\\n\\n Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him,\\nWe also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship\\nimmediately; and that night they caught nothing.\\n\\n But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but\\nthe disciples knew not that it was Jesus.\\n\\n Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They\\nanswered him, No.\\n\\n And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the\\nship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not\\nable to draw it for the multitude of fishes.\\n\\n Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is\\nthe Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his\\nfisher’s coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into\\nthe sea.\\n\\n And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not\\nfar from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net\\nwith fishes.\\n\\n As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals\\nthere, and fish laid thereon, and bread.\\n\\n Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now\\ncaught.\\n\\n Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great\\nfishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so\\nmany, yet was not the net broken.\\n\\n Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples\\ndurst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.\\n\\n Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish\\nlikewise.\\n\\n This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his\\ndisciples, after that he was risen from the dead.\\n\\n So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son\\nof Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea,\\nLord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.\\n\\n He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas,\\nlovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love\\nthee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.\\n\\n He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest\\nthou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time,\\nLovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things;\\nthou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.\\n\\n Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou\\ngirdest thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou\\nshalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall\\ngird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.\\n\\n This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God.\\nAnd when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.\\n\\n Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved\\nfollowing; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord,\\nwhich is he that betrayeth thee?   Peter seeing him saith to\\nJesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?   Jesus saith unto him,\\nIf I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou\\nme.\\n\\n Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that\\ndisciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not\\ndie; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?\\n This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote\\nthese things: and we know that his testimony is true.\\n\\n And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which,\\nif they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world\\nitself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n']"

       "['When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\\n\\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.–That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, –That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.–Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.\\n\\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\\n\\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\\n\\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\\n\\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.\\n\\nHe has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\\n\\nHe has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\\n\\nHe has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\\n\\nHe has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.\\n\\nHe has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\\n\\nHe has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.\\n\\nHe has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.\\n\\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.\\n\\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:\\n\\nFor Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\\n\\nFor protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\\n\\nFor cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\\n\\nFor imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:\\n\\nFor depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:\\n\\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences\\n\\nFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:\\n\\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\\n\\nFor suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\\n\\nHe has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.\\n\\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\\n\\nHe is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.\\n\\nHe has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\\n\\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\\n\\nIn every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\\n\\nNor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.\\n\\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.\\n',\n",
       " 'No man thinks more highly than I do of the patriotism, as well as abilities, of the very worthy gentlemen who have just addressed the House. But different men often see the same subject in different lights; and, therefore, I hope it will not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen if, entertaining as I do opinions of a character very opposite to theirs, I shall speak forth my sentiments freely and without reserve. This is no time for ceremony. The question before the House is one of awful moment to this country. For my own part, I consider it as nothing less than a question of freedom or slavery; and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the freedom of the debate. It is only in this way that we can hope to arrive at truth, and fulfill the great responsibility which we hold to God and our country. Should I keep back my opinions at such a time, through fear of giving offense, I should consider myself as guilty of treason towards my country, and of an act of disloyalty toward the Majesty of Heaven, which I revere above all earthly kings.\\n\\nMr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the song of that siren till she transforms us into beasts. Is this the part of wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty? Are we disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes, see not, and, having ears, hear not, the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation? For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it.\\n\\nI have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of experience. I know of no way of judging of the future but by the past. And judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the conduct of the British ministry for the last ten years to justify those hopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the House. Is it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received? Trust it not, sir; it will prove a snare to your feet. Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed with a kiss. Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our petition comports with those warlike preparations which cover our waters and darken our land. Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation? Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that force must be called in to win back our love? Let us not deceive ourselves, sir. These are the implements of war and subjugation; the last arguments to which kings resort. I ask gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array, if its purpose be not to force us to submission? Can gentlemen assign any other possible motive for it? Has Great Britain any enemy, in this quarter of the world, to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies? No, sir, she has none. They are meant for us: they can be meant for no other. They are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which the British ministry have been so long forging. And what have we to oppose to them? Shall we try argument? Sir, we have been trying that for the last ten years. Have we anything new to offer upon the subject? Nothing. We have held the subject up in every light of which it is capable; but it has been all in vain. Shall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication? What terms shall we find which have not been already exhausted? Let us not, I beseech you, sir, deceive ourselves. Sir, we have done everything that could be done to avert the storm which is now coming on. We have petitioned; we have remonstrated; we have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and Parliament. Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded; and we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne! In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation. There is no longer any room for hope. If we wish to be free-- if we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for which we have been so long contending--if we mean not basely to abandon the noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged, and which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained--we must fight! I repeat it, sir, we must fight! An appeal to arms and to the God of hosts is all that is left us!\\n\\nThey tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidable an adversary. But when shall we be stronger? Will it be the next week, or the next year? Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British guard shall be stationed in every house? Shall we gather strength by irresolution and inaction? Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot? Sir, we are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power. The millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a country as that which we possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us. Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone. There is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations, and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us. The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave. Besides, sir, we have no election. If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too late to retire from the contest. There is no retreat but in submission and slavery! Our chains are forged! Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston! The war is inevitable--and let it come! I repeat it, sir, let it come.\\n\\nIt is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace-- but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!\\n',\n",
       " \"When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one portion of the family of man to assume among the people of the earth a position different from that which they have hitherto occupied, but one to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes that impel them to such a course.\\n\\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men and women are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights governments are instituted, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. Whenever any form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of those who suffer from it to refuse allegiance to it, and to insist upon the institution of a new government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly, all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves, by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their duty to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of the women under this government, and such is now the necessity which constrains them to demand the equal station to which they are entitled.\\n\\nThe history of mankind is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations on the part of man toward woman, having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over her. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.\\n\\nHe has never permitted her to exercise her inalienable right to the elective franchise.\\nHe has compelled her to submit to laws, in the formation of which she had no voice.\\nHe has withheld from her rights which are given to the most ignorant and degraded men - both natives and foreigners.\\nHaving deprived her of this first right of a citizen, the elective franchise, thereby leaving her without representation in the halls of legislation, he has oppressed her on all sides.\\nHe has made her, if married, in the eye of the law, civilly dead.\\nHe has taken from her all right in property, even to the wages she earns.\\nHe has made her, morally, an irresponsible being, as she can commit many crimes, with impunity, provided they be done in the presence of her husband. In the covenant of marriage, she is compelled to promise obedience to her husband, he becoming, to all intents and purposes, her master - the law giving him power to deprive her of her liberty, and to administer chastisement.\\nHe has so framed the laws of divorce, as to what shall be the proper causes of divorce; in case of separation, to whom the guardianship of the children shall be given, as to be wholly regardless of the happiness of women - the law, in all cases, going upon the false supposition of the supremacy of man, and giving all power into his hands.\\nAfter depriving her of all rights as a married woman, if single and the owner of property, he has taxed her to support a government which recognizes her only when her property can be made profitable to it.\\nHe has monopolized nearly all the profitable employments, and from those she is permitted to follow, she receives but a scanty remuneration.\\nHe closes against her all the avenues to wealth and distinction, which he considers most honorable to himself. As a teacher of theology, medicine, or law, she is not known.\\nHe has denied her the facilities for obtaining a thorough education - all colleges being closed against her.\\nHe allows her in Church as well as State, but a subordinate position, claiming Apostolic authority for her exclusion from the ministry, and with some exceptions, from any public participation in the affairs of the Church.\\nHe has created a false public sentiment, by giving to the world a different code of morals for men and women, by which moral delinquencies which exclude women from society, are not only tolerated but deemed of little account in man.\\nHe has usurped the prerogative of Jehovah himself, claiming it as his right to assign for her a sphere of action, when that belongs to her conscience and her God.\\nHe has endeavored, in every way that he could to destroy her confidence in her own powers, to lessen her self-respect, and to make her willing to lead a dependent and abject life.\\nNow, in view of this entire disfranchisement of one-half the people of this country, their social and religious degradation, - in view of the unjust laws above mentioned, and because women do feel themselves aggrieved, oppressed, and fraudulently deprived of their most sacred rights, we insist that they have immediate admission to all the rights and privileges which belong to them as citizens of these United States.\\n\\nIn entering upon the great work before us, we anticipate no small amount of misconception, misrepresentation, and ridicule; but we shall use every instrumentality within our power to effect our object. We shall employ agents, circulate tracts, petition the State and national Legislatures, and endeavor to enlist the pulpit and the press in our behalf. We hope this Convention will be followed by a series of Conventions, embracing every part of the country.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\\n\\nNow we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.\\n\\nBut, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate – we can not consecrate – we can not hallow – this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us – that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion – that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain – that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom – and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\\n',\n",
       " 'Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of captivity.\\n\\n \\n\\nBut one hundred years later, we must face the tragic fact that the Negro is still not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. So we have come here today to dramatize an appalling condition.\\n\\n \\n\\nIn a sense we have come to our nation\\'s capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men would be guaranteed the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check which has come back marked \"insufficient funds.\" But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check -- a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice. We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to open the doors of opportunity to all of God\\'s children. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood.\\n\\nIt would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment and to underestimate the determination of the Negro. This sweltering summer of the Negro\\'s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force. The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny and their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, \"When will you be satisfied?\" We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro\\'s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.\\n\\nI am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow cells. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.\\n\\n\\n\\nGo back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair.\\n\\n\\n\\nI say to you today, my friends, that in spite of the difficulties and frustrations of the moment, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.\\n\\n\\n\\nI have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nI have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slaveowners will be able to sit down together at a table of brotherhood.\\n\\n\\n\\nI have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a desert state, sweltering with the heat of injustice and oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.\\n\\n\\n\\nI have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.\\n\\nI have a dream today.\\n\\n\\n\\nI have a dream that one day the state of Alabama, whose governor\\'s lips are presently dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, will be transformed into a situation where little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls and walk together as sisters and brothers.\\n\\n\\n\\nI have a dream today.\\n\\n\\n\\nI have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is our hope. This is the faith with which I return to the South. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis will be the day when all of God\\'s children will be able to sing with a new meaning, \"My country, \\'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrim\\'s pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd if America is to be a great nation this must become true. So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.\\n\\nLet freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania!\\n\\n\\n\\nLet freedom ring from the snowcapped Rockies of Colorado!\\n\\n\\n\\nLet freedom ring from the curvaceous peaks of California!\\n\\n\\n\\nBut not only that; let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia!\\n\\n\\n\\nLet freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee!\\n\\n\\n\\nLet freedom ring from every hill and every molehill of Mississippi. From every mountainside, let freedom ring.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen we let freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God\\'s children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, \"Free at last! free at last! thank God Almighty, we are free at last!\"\\n']"

    "\n",
    "The _Federalist Papers_ were a set of 85 essays published between 1787 and 1788 to promote the ratification of the United States Constitution. They were originally published under the pseudonym \"Publius\". Although the identity of the authors was a closely guarded secret at the time, most of the papers have since been conclusively attributed to one of [Hamilton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YHVPNOHySk), Jay, or Madison. The known authorships can be found in `https://dlsun.github.io/pods/data/federalist/authorship.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For 15 of the papers, however, the authorships remain disputed. (These papers can be identified from the `authorship.csv` file because the \"Author\" field is blank.) In this analysis, you will use the papers with known authorship to predict the authorships of the disputed papers. The text of each paper is available at `https://dlsun.github.io/pods/data/federalist/x.txt`, where `x` is the number of the paper (i.e., a number from 1 to 85). The name of the file indicates the number of the paper."

    "When analyzing an author's style, common words like \"the\" and \"on\" are actually more useful than rare words like \"hostilities\". That is because rare words typically signify context. Context is useful if you are trying to find documents about similar topics, but not so useful if you are trying to identify an author's style because different authors can write about the same topic. For example, both Dr. Seuss and Charles Dickens used rare words like \"chimney\" and \"stockings\" in _How the Grinch Stole Christmas_ and _A Christmas Carol_, respectively. But they used common words very differently: Dickens used the word \"upon\" over 100 times, while Dr. Seuss did not use \"upon\" even once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read in the Federalist Papers. Convert each one into a vector of term frequencies. In order to restrict to common words, include only the top 50 words across the corpus. (Because we are restricting to the most common words already, there is no reason to reweight them using TF-IDF, since the most common words will be in all the documents.)"
