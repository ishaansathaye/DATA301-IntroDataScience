For most people, the first image that comes to mind is a spreadsheet, where each row represents something for which information is being measured and each column a type of measurement. This stereotype exists for a reason; many real-world data sets can indeed be organized this way. Data that can be represented using rows and columns is called **tabular data**. The rows are also called **observations** or **records**,  while the columns are called **variables** or **fields**. The different terms reflect the diverse communities within data science, and their origins are summarized in the table below.\n",
