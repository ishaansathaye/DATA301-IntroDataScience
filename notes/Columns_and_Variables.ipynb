        "\n",
        "Variables like `religion` or `pets` that place the observational units into a relatively limited set of categories are called **categorical variables**. We call each possible value of a categorical variable a \"level\". Levels are usually non-numeric.\n",
        "\n",
        "Just because a variable happens to contain numbers does not necessarily make it \"quantitative\". For example, we could code the variable *Section* for the students in DATA 301 this quarter as 5 or 7, but Section is still a categorical variable; we could easily replace 5 with \"first\" or \"early\" and 7 with \"second\" or \"late\".  To see if a variable is quantitative, ask \"would it make sense to take an average\"? It doesn't really make sense to take an average of Section. On the other hand, if the variable is *number of classes enrolled in*, it does make sense to take an average---for example, \"CP students take on average 4.2 classes per quarter\"---even though this variable only takes discrete values like 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\n",
        "\n",
        "Some variables do not fit neatly into the categorical/quantitative classification. For example, the variable `essay1` contains users' answers to the prompt \"What Iâ€™m doing with my life\". This variable is obviously not quantitative, but it is not categorical either because every user has a unique answer. In other words, this variable does not place each observation into a reasonable set of categories. We will group such variables into an \"other\" category.\n",
