Since areal units---like countries, states, and counties---are polygons in general, the most important type of patch for making a choropleth is the `Polygon`. A `Polygon` is specified by a list of its vertices; see the **geometry** column. Thus, one way to create a choropleth is to draw the `Polygon` for each county, one at a time, setting the face color of each patch to an appropriate color based on the data value for that county.

        "For example, President Donald Trump cites the large amount of red area on the 2016 electoral map as an indication of overwhelming support for him. However, the total amount of red area is a statistic that conflates two unrelated quantities: the geographic size of a county and the depth of support for Trump. In fact, most of the red area is in rural parts of the country where few people live. From the choropleth, one would never guess that more people actually voted for his opponent Hillary Clinton! She received strong support from urban areas, but unfortunately for her, cities can barely be seen on a map---despite being home to a majority of Americans.\n",
