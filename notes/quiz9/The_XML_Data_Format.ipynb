        "- Indentation is used to make the code more readable (to make it easier to see the nesting structure). But it is optional.\n",

In the example above, there are multiple instances of `<movie>` within `<movies>` and multiple instances of `<character>` within `<movie>`, so `movie` and `character` are both repeated fields. (In fact, `director` is also a repeated field, but it is impossible to tell from the code above, since the movies shown above only have one director.)\n",
