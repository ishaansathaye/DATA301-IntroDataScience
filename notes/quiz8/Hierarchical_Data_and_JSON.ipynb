        "\n",
        "A lot of data in the real world is naturally hierarchical. As an example, consider a data set where each observation is a TV show. Many of the variables in this data set are what we would expect, such as the runtime of each show and what network it was broadcast on. But there are also variables that are unorthodox, such as the season and the cast. A TV show can have multiple seasons and multiple cast members, as illustated in the figure below.\n",

        "Can we represent all of this information in a single `DataFrame`? If each row represents a single show, then it is straightforward to have columns containing the runtimes, the premiere dates, and so on. But it is not obvious how to incorporate the season information into this `DataFrame` in a way that still makes this information accessible for analysis. There are multiple challenges:\n",
        "\n",
        "- A show has multiple seasons. We will need multiple columns, one for each season.\n",
        "- The number of seasons varies from show to show. For example, \"Girls\" was on for 6 seasons, while \"The Golden Girls\" was on for 7. We will need to have at least 7 columns in our `DataFrame` to be able to store all the information for \"The Golden Girls\", even though we only need 6 columns for \"Girls\" (and perhaps even fewer for other shows).\n",
        "- Each season has multiple variables associated with it, such as the premiere date and the end date. We will need a separate column for each of these variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "The resulting `DataFrame` might look something like this.\n",

        "The problem is that this data is naturally hierarchical. A TV show can have multiple cast members and multiple seasons; furthermore, each season can have multiple episodes. Hierarchical data requires a different storage format, which we'll explore now."

              "      'summary': \"<p>This 90-minute special broadcasted on the Lifetime network in June 2003 served as a reunion show for 3 out of the 4 golden girls. Unfortunately, Estelle Getty could not attend because of her Parkinson's disease. Basically, this show has clips from the girls' favorite musical and show moments, as well as some never before seen (and unfortunately censored) bloopers and outtakes from the show. In addition to the aforementioned, the special contains the girls' favorite scenes and music numbers as well as interviews with the girls, executive producers Paul Junger Witt and Tony Thomas, and creator and talented writer Susan Harris. The special earned Lifetime an all time high rating. After the special originally aired, Lifetimed broadcasted the pilot and finale episodes. Please be aware that syndication requires more commercial time, so you may notice that two or three minutes of dialogue and/or scenes may be missing. Other than that, the special was very interesting and very well done.</p>\"},\n",

The latest original, animated comedy series from Cartoon Network Studios, The Powerpuff Girls premieres with back-to-back episodes on Monday, April 4 at 6 p.m. (ET, PT). Following this premiere are two action-packed weeks of new episodes (Monday-Friday, April 4 through 15 at 6 p.m. ET, PT), leading into the show's regular time slot, Thursdays at 6 p.m. (ET, PT), on April 21. The Powerpuff Girls will kick off its global return to television with a world premiere event on Monday, March 14 at the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in Austin, Tex. This fan-centric experience will feature a world premiere screening, pre-party and parade with giant-balloon likenesses of all three Powerpuff Girls. Fast on the heels of the U.S. event, premieres will commence in regions around the globe including Europe, Asia and Latin America. Superhero sisters Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup are known to their fellow citizens of Townsville as The Powerpuff Girls. Together, they protect their beautiful, bustling metropolis from sinister evildoers, intent on taking over. Juggling school, homework and a regular parade of villains is no easy task, but The Powerpuff Girls are more than up to the challenge. Armed with supercool superpowers and some topnotch teamwork, The Powerpuff Girls, with occasional assistance from Professor Utonium and the Mayor of Townsville, show their hometown and the world that it is possible to save the world before bedtime.</p>\",\n",

After lunch, an insanely jealous Paris accosts Rory and tells her the group that she innocently stumbled into is \"The Puffs\", Chilton\\'s famed secret sorority. Paris would do anything to join, and she begs Rory not to bad-mouth her to the group. At the next opportunity, Rory talks Paris up to the group and they are both accepted as pledges.

They end up looking terrific and having a ball struting their stuff on the runway, and the show is a tremendous success. Back in Stars Hollow, Lorelai visits Luke at the diner and asks him not to go out with Eva.

Luke sees right through her, and after letting her know that he\\'ll date whoever he pleases, tells her that he\\'s not interested in Eva and was only giving her directions back to Hartford.

When Lorelai finally summons up the courage to tell her about their plans, Mia is supportive and enthusiastic, and announces that this was just the opportunity she was waiting for to sell the Inn. Lorelai is saddened at this news and tells Emily how much the Inn means to her as the place where she and Rory grew up together, oblivious to the pain she is causing her mother. Lorelai's emotional turmoil culminates with having her first ever argument with Sookie. After a pep talk from Luke, Lorelai apologizes to Sookie and recommits to their friendship and partnership.

Mia explains that she took them in to give them a place to feel safe, while Emily explains that she wanted Mia to send them home. Emily asks Mia if she has any pictures of the girls from those days, and Mia eagerly agrees to send them to her right away.

Later that evening, Luke, Lorelai, Rory and Mia stumble upon a secret town meeting where Jess is accused once more and Luke is vilified for bringing him into town. Luke stands behind his nephew again, supported by Lorelai. The next day, Rory tells Jess that she knows he's really the culprit, and that he's being a jerk for letting Luke take all the heat from everyone in Stars Hollow.

              "      'summary': '<p>Lorelai receives a late wedding present without a card attached, and insists that it be returned. Sookie sees to what great lengths Lorelai is going to find out who sent it, and tells Lorelai to move forward in life to get some closure on her relationship with Max. Lorelai takes her advice and accepts a dinner date with Paul, one of the other students in her business class. The date goes well, but they decide to remain friends because they don\\'t have very much in common. When Paul appears at Luke\\'s the following Saturday with his parents in tow, Lorelai gets ribbed by everyone in town because he\\'s so young. Luke is uncharacteristically quiet, which Lorelai can\\'t figure out until Sookie explains that he\\'s had a crush on Lorelai forever. Lorelai goes to him to let him know that he\\'ll always be a very important part of her life, and Luke brightens up again. Rory, Paris, Madeline and Louise are assigned to present the death scene from \"Romeo and Juliet\" as part of ther class participation in the Chilton Shakespearean Festival. Since this production will account for half of their grade, Paris takes over as director and assigns Rory the role of Juliet. Tristan returns to school with Duncan and Bowman after their suspension, and is cast as Romeo against Rory\\'s wishes. When a scheduling mixup occurs with the rehearsal hall, Rory is horrified to learn that Paris has rented Miss Patty\\'s studio and that the group will convene in Stars Hollow to practice. Tristan wastes no time in going to the market and taunting Dean, and they nearly come to blows before Rory pulls them apart. The next day at school, Rory pleads with Tristan not to mention anything to Dean about their kiss at the party, because it meant nothing to her. She also cautions him about hanging out with Duncan and Bowman. Stung by her words, but hiding it well, Tristan storms off. The next day Dean shows up to watch rehearsal and Tristan taunts both Dean and Rory before he finally bails to go off with Duncan and Bowman. On the evening of the performance, Paris freaks out because Tristan is nowhere to be found. He finally shows up to tell Rory that his father has pulled him out of Chilton to send him to boarding school, because he was caught with Duncan and Bowman breaking into Bowman\\'s father\\'s safe on a lark. Paris storms off, puts on his costume, and takes over as Romeo, thereby saving the day, the performance, and their grades.</p>'},\n",

Luke reminds Lorelai of how they met, shows her a horoscope she gave him for good luck that he's kept in his wallet, and assures her that he intends to go the distance with her. Lorelai spends the night at Luke's place; in the morning, she goes down to the diner to get coffee, and the breakfast crowd sees her wearing only Luke's shirt. There's surprisingly little gossip about Luke and Lorelai until the next town meeting, where Taylor uses charts to show how disastrous a breakup between them would be for Stars Hollow. Meanwhile: Rory meets a rich Yale student named Logan and chews him out for being rude to her friend Marty; Paris holds a wake for Asher that all the guests assume is a keg party with a weird theme; and Emily freaks out when she discovers that Richard has a social life she doesn't know about, so she invades Rory's dorm during the wake.</p>\"},\n",

Unfortunately, Estelle Getty could not attend because of her Parkinson's disease. Basically, this show has clips from the girls' favorite musical and show moments, as well as some never before seen (and unfortunately censored) bloopers and outtakes from the show. In addition to the aforementioned, the special contains the girls' favorite scenes and music numbers as well as interviews with the girls, executive producers Paul Junger Witt and Tony Thomas, and creator and talented writer Susan Harris. The special earned Lifetime an all time high rating. After the special originally aired, Lifetimed broadcasted the pilot and finale episodes. Please be aware that syndication requires more commercial time, so you may notice that two or three minutes of dialogue and/or scenes may be missing. Other than that, the special was very interesting and very well done.</p>\"},\n",

This is a time of armed police in armoured Land Rovers and British Army check points. But it's also the time of Murder She Wrote, The Cranberries, MJ and Lisa Marie, Doc Martens, bomber jackets, The X Files, Nirvana and Wayne's World. And while The Troubles may hang over her home town, Erin has troubles of her own</p>\",\n",
