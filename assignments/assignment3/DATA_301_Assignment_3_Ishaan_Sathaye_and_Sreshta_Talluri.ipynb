        "\n",
        "The 2000 presidential election---between Republican George W. Bush, Democrat Al Gore, and other third-party candidates---was one of the closest in American history. The election came down to one state, Florida, which Bush won by just 537 votes (out of nearly 6,000,000 votes cast in the state).\n",
        "\n",
        "After Election Day, Democrats claimed that the [\"butterfly ballot\"](https://ischool.uw.edu/podcasts/dtctw/palm-beach-county-butterfly-ballot) that was used in Palm Beach County confused Gore voters into voting for Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan. To vote for Gore, who is listed second on the left, a voter actually had to punch the third hole (because the second hole is actually a vote for Buchanan, who is listed first on the right).\n",
        "\n",
        "In this exercise, you will evaluate this claim. The data file `https://dlsun.github.io/pods/data/florida.csv` contains county-level information about:\n",
        "\n",
        "- the number of votes for Gore, Bush, Buchanan, and a few other candidates in the 2000 presidential election\n",
        "- the number of votes for Clinton (Democrat), Dole (Republican), and Perot (Reform) in the 1996 presidential election\n",
        "- the number of votes for Buchanan in the 1996 primary\n",
        "- the number of registered Reform voters and the total number of registered voters\n",
        "\n",
        "Using this data, evaluate the claim that many voters in Palm Beach County voted for Buchanan when they intended to vote for Gore.\n",
        "You should check whether Palm Beach County fits the general pattern of the other counties in Florida, but you need to decide how to measure/visualize the \"general pattern\". Visualizations will likely be more helpful than summary statistics.\n",
        "Then, craft a story that guides the reader through your discoveries. Your story should contain both figures and explanations.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many ways to approach this problem. You don't have to explore every possibility, but you should include at least more than one perspective. That is, you should include several plots/summaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hint: you can add new columns to the data frame. For example, the current columns contain counts, but you might also want to consider proportions. Also, you have the 1996 data for a reason, so you should make some comparisons between 2000 and 1996 (e.g., you might want to compute changes from 1996 to 2000.)"

They conducted an experiment in which subjects had to learn about sea otters by reading a passage. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: some were instructed to create a [concept map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_map) as they read the passage, while others were instructed to practice retrieval (i.e., read the passage, recall as much as they could, read the text again, and recall again).

However, if we put the data in context with the species (as shown in the above graph), we see that for each species there is actually a positive correlation (can see with the trendline as well). Also, each species has its own range for bill lengths or bill depths, most likely due to evolution and them adapting to their surroundings.**\n",

A bar graph or line graph would not be able to show the data in the same way where it is easy for the audience to visually see what the general trend is. I saw something similar in the Plotly Graph Gallery that had observations graphed on a scatter plot, colored by a certain variable, and then had a box plot for each axis. I thought that this would be perfect for our penguin data as we want to see how bill depth is related to bill length, but we can also compare each independently. The hardest part was finding out about the marginalx and the marginaly to create the boxplots specific to each axis.**"
